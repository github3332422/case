Text 1
There are a great many careers in which the increasing emphasis is on specialization. You find these careers in engineering, in production, in statistical work, and in teaching. But there is an increasing demand for people who are able to take in great area at a glance, people who perhaps do not know too much about any one field. There is, in other words, a demand for people who are capable of seeing the forest rather than the trees, of making general judgments. We can call these people “generalists.” And these “generalists” are particularly needed for positions in administration, where it is their job to see that other people do the work, where they have to plan for other people, to organize other people’s work, to begin it and judge it.
The specialist understands one field; his concern is with technique and tools. He is a “trained” man; and his educational background is properly technical or professional. The generalist -- and especially the administrator -- deals with people; his concern is with leadership, with planning, and with direction giving. He is an “educated” man; and the humanities are his strongest foundation. Very rarely is a specialist capable of being an administrator. And very rarely is a good generalist also a good specialist in particular field. Any organization needs both kinds of people, though different organizations need them in different proportions. It is your task to find out, during your training period, into which of the two kinds of jobs you fit, and to plan your career accordingly.
Your first job may turn out to be the right job for you -- but this is pure accident. Certainly you should not change jobs constantly or people will become suspicious of your ability to hold any job. At the same time you must not look upon the first job as the final job; it is primarily a training job, an opportunity to understand yourself and your fitness for being an employee.
26.	There is an increasing demand for ________.
[A] all round people in their own fields
[B] people whose job is to organize other people’s work
[C] generalists whose educational background is either technical or professional
[D] specialists whose chief concern is to provide administrative guidance to others
27.	The specialist is ________.
[A] a man whose job is to train other people
[B] a man who has been trained in more than one fields
[C] a man who can see the forest rather than the trees
[D] a man whose concern is mainly with technical or professional matters
28.	The administrator is ________.
[A] a “trained” man who is more a specialist than a generalist
[B] a man who sees the trees as well as the forest
[C] a man who is very strong in the humanities
[D] a man who is an “educated” specialist
29.	During your training period, it is important ________.
[A] to try to be a generalist
[B] to choose a profitable job
[C] to find an organization which fits you
[D] to decide whether you are fit to be a specialist or a generalist
30.	A man’s first job ________.
[A] is never the right job for him
[B] should not be regarded as his final job
[C] should not be changed or people will become suspicious of his ability to hold any job
[D] is primarily an opportunity to fit himself for his final job
Test 2
At the bottom of the world lies a mighty continent still wrapped in the Ice Age and, until recent times, unknown to man. It is a great land mass with mountain ranges whose extent and elevation are still uncertain. Much of the continent is a complete blank on our maps. Man has explored, on foot, less than one per cent of its area. Antarctica differs fundamentally from the Arctic regions. The Arctic is an ocean, covered with drifting packed ice and hemmed in by the land masses of Europe, Asia, and North America. The Antarctic is a continent almost as large as Europe and Australia combined, centered roughly on the South Pole and surrounded by the most unobstructed water areas of the world -- the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans.
The continental ice sheet is more than two miles high in its centre, thus, the air over the Antarctic is far more refrigerated than it is over the Arctic regions. This cold air current from the land is so forceful that it makes the nearby seas the stormiest in the world and renders unlivable those regions whose counterparts at the opposite end of the globe are inhabited. Thus, more than a million persons live within 2,000 miles of the North Pole in an area that includes most of Alaska, Siberia, and Scandinavia -- a region rich in forest and mining industries. Apart from a handful of weather stations, within the same distance of the South Pole there is not a single tree, industry, or settlement.
31.	The best title for this selection would be ________.
[A] Iceland
[B] Land of Opportunity
[C] The Unknown Continent
[D] Utopia at Last
32.	At the time this article was written, our knowledge of Antarctica was ________.
[A] very limited
[B] vast
[C] fairly rich
[D] nonexistent
33.	Antarctica is bordered by the ________.
[A] Pacific Ocean
[B] Indian Ocean
[C] Atlantic Ocean
[D] All three
34.	The Antarctic is made uninhabitable primarily by ________.
[A] cold air
[B] calm seas
[C] ice
[D] lack of knowledge about the continent
35.	According to this article ________.
[A] 2,000 people live on the Antarctic Continent
[B] a million people live within 2,000 miles of the South Pole
[C] weather conditions within a 2,000 mile radius of the South Pole make settlements impractical
[D] only a handful of natives inhabit Antarctica

Section VIII: English-Chinese Translation
Directions:
Translate the following passage into Chinese. Only the underlined sentences are to be translated. (20 points)
It would be interesting to discover how many young people go to university without any clear idea of what they are going to do afterwards. (71) If one considers the enormous variety of courses offered, it is not hard to see how difficult it is for a student to select the course most suited to his interests and abilities. (72) If a student goes to university to acquire a broader perspective of life, to enlarge his ideas and to learn to think for himself, he will undoubtedly benefit. (73) Schools often have too restricting an atmosphere, with its time tables and disciplines, to allow him much time for independent assessment of the work he is asked to do. (74) Most students would, I believe, profit by a year of such exploration of different academic studies, especially those “all rounders” with no particular interest. They should have longer time to decide in what subject they want to take their degrees, so that in later life, they do not look back and say, “I should like to have been an archaeologist. If I hadn’t taken a degree in Modern Languages, I shouldn’t have ended up as an interpreter, but it’s too late now. I couldn’t go back and begin all over again.”
(75) There is, of course, another side to the question of how to make the best use of one’s time at university. (76) This is the case of the student who excels in a particular branch of learning. (77) He is immediately accepted by the University of his choice, and spends his three or four years becoming a specialist, emerging with a first-class Honour Degree and very little knowledge of what the rest of the world is all about. (78) It therefore becomes more and more important that, if students are not to waste their opportunities, there will have to be much more detailed information about courses and more advice. Only in this way can we be sure that we are not to have, on the one hand, a band of specialists ignorant of anything outside of their own subject, and on the other hand, an ever increasing number of graduates qualified in subjects for which there is little or no demand in the working world.

Text 1
For centuries men dreamed of achieving vertical flight. In 400 A.D. Chinese children played with a fan-like toy that spun upwards and fell back to earth as rotation ceased. Leonardo da Vinci conceive the first mechanical apparatus, called a “Helix,” which could carry man straight up, but was only a design and was never tested.
The ancient-dream was finally realized in 1940 when a Russian engineer piloted a strange looking craft of steel tubing with a rotating fan on top. It rose awkwardly and vertically into the air from a standing start, hovered a few feet above the ground, went sideways and backwards, and then settled back to earth. The vehicle was called a helicopter.
Imaginations were fired. Men dreamed of going to work in their own personal helicopters. People anticipate that vertical flight transports would carry millions of passengers as do the airliners of today. Such fantastic expectations were not fulfilled.
The helicopter has now become an extremely useful machine. It excels in military missions, carrying troops, guns and strategic instruments where other aircraft cannot go. Corporations use them as airborne offices, many metropolitan areas use them in police work, construction and logging companies employ them in various advantageous ways, engineers use them for site selection and surveying, and oil companies use them as the best way to make offshore and remote work stations accessible to crews and supplies. Any urgent mission to a hard-to-get-to place is a likely task for a helicopter. Among their other multitude of used: deliver people across town, fly to and from airports, assist in rescue work, and aid in the search for missing or wanted persons.
11.	People expect that ________.
[A] the airliners of today would eventually be replaced by helicopters
[B] helicopters would someday be able to transport large number of people from place to place as airliners are now doing
[C] the imaginations fired by the Russian engineer’s invention would become a reality in the future
[D] their fantastic expectations about helicopters could be fulfilled by airliners of today
12.	Helicopters work with the aid of ________.
[A] a combination of rotating devices in front and on top
[B] a rotating device topside
[C] one rotating fan in the center of the aircraft and others at each end
[D] a rotating fan underneath for lifting
13.	What is said about the development of the helicopter?
[A] Helicopters have only been worked on by man since 1940.
[B] Chinese children were the first to achieve flight in helicopters.
[C] Helicopters were considered more dangerous than the early airplanes.
[D] Some people thought they would become widely used by average individuals.
14.	How has the use of helicopters developed?
[A] They have been widely used for various purposes.
[B] They are taking the place of high-flying jets.
[C] They are used for rescue work.
[D] They are now used exclusively for commercial projects.
15.	Under what conditions are helicopters found to be absolutely essential?
[A] For overseas passenger transportation.
[B] For extremely high altitude flights.
[C] For high-speed transportation.
[D] For urgent mission to places inaccessible to other kinds of craft.

In ancient Greece athletic festivals were very important and had strong religious associations. The Olympian athletic festival held every four years in honor of Zeus, king of the Olympian Gods, eventually lost its local character, became first a national event and then, after the rules against foreign competitors had been abolished, international. No one knows exactly how far back the Olympic Games go, but some official records date from 776 B.C. The games took place in August on the plain by Mount Olympus. Many thousands of spectators gathered from all parts of Greece, but no married woman was admitted even as a spectator. Slaves, women and dishonored persons were not allowed to compete. The exact sequence of events uncertain, but events included boy’s gymnastics, boxing, wrestling, horse racing and field events, though there were fewer sports involved than in the modern Olympic Games.
On the last day of the Games, all the winners were honored by having a ring of holy olive leaves placed on their heads. So great was the honor that the winner of the foot race gave his name to the year of his victory. Although Olympic winners received no prize money, they were, in fact, richly rewarded by their state authorities. How their results compared with modern standards, we unfortunately have no means of telling.
After an uninterrupted history of almost 1,200 years, the Games were suspended by the Romans in 394 A.D. They continued for such a long time because people believed in the philosophy behind the Olympics: the idea that a healthy body produced a healthy mind, and that the spirit of competition in sports and games was preferable to the competition that caused wars. It was over 1,500 years before another such international athletic gathering took place in Athens in 1896.
Nowadays, the Games are held in different countries in turn. The host country provides vast facilities, including a stadium, swimming pools and living accommodation, but competing courtiers pay their own athletes’ expenses.
The Olympics start with the arrival in the stadium of a torch, lighted on Mount Olympus by the sun’s rays. It is carried by a succession of runners to the stadium. The torch symbolized the continuation of the ancient Greek athletic ideals, and it burns throughout the Games until the closing ceremony. The well-known Olympic flag, however, is a modern conception: the five interlocking rings symbolize the uniting of all five continents participating in the Games.
16.	In ancient Greece, the Olympic Games ________.
[A] were merely national athletic festivals
[B] were in the nature of a national event with a strong religious colour
[C] had rules which put foreign participants in a disadvantageous position
[D] were primarily national events with few foreign participants

In science the meaning of the word “explain” suffers with civilization’s every step in search of reality. Science cannot really explain electricity, magnetism, and gravitation; their effects can be measured and predicted, but of their nature no more is known to the modern scientist than to Thales who first looked into the nature of the electrification of amber, a hard yellowish-brown gum. Most contemporary physicists reject the notion that man can ever discover what these mysterious forces “really” are. “Electricity,” Bertrand Russell says, “is not a thing, like St. Paul’s Cathedral; it is a way in which things behave. When we have told how things behave when they are electrified, and under what circumstances they are electrified, we have told all there is to tell.” Until recently scientists would have disapproved of such an idea. Aristotle, for example, whose natural science dominated Western thought for two thousand years, believed that man could arrive at an understanding of reality by reasoning from self-evident principles. He felt, for example, that it is a self-evident principle that everything in the universe has its proper place, hence one can deduce that objects fall to the ground because that’s where they belong, and smoke goes up because that’s where it belongs. The goal of Aristotelian science was to explain why things happen. Modern science was born when Galileo began trying to explain how things happen and thus originated the method of controlled experiment which now forms the basis of scientific investigation.
21.	The aim of controlled scientific experiments is ________.
[A] to explain why things happen
[B] to explain how things happen
[C] to describe self-evident principles
[D] to support Aristotelian science
22.	What principles most influenced scientific thought for two thousand years?
[A] the speculations of Thales
[B] the forces of electricity, magnetism, and gravity

[D] Galileo’s discoveries
23.	Bertrand Russell’s notion about electricity is ________.
[A] disapproved of by most modern scientists
[B] in agreement with Aristotle’s theory of self-evident principles
[C] in agreement with scientific investigation directed toward “how” things happen
[D] in agreement with scientific investigation directed toward “why” things happen
24.	The passage says that until recently scientists disagreed with the idea ________.
[A] that there are mysterious forces in the universe
[B] that man cannot discover what forces “really” are
[C] that there are self-evident principles
[D] that we can discover why things behave as they do
25.	Modern science came into being ________.
[A] when the method of controlled experiment was first introduced
[B] when Galileo succeeded in explaining how things happen
[C] when Aristotelian scientist tried to explain why things happen
[D] when scientists were able to acquire an understanding of reality of reasoning

Section VIII: English-Chinese Translation
Directions:
Translate the following passage into Chinese. Only the underlined sentences are to be translated. (20 points)
Have there always been cities? (71) Life without large urban areas may seem inconceivable to us, but actually cities are relatively recent development. Groups with primitive economics still manage without them. The trend, however, is for such groups to disappear, while cities are increasingly becoming the dominant mode of man’s social existence. (72) Historically, city life has always been among the elements which form a civilization. Any high degree of human endeavor and achievement has been closely linked to life in an urban environment. (73) It is virtually impossible to imagine that universities, hospitals, large businesses or even science and technology could have come into being without cities to support them. To most people, cities have traditionally been the areas where there was a concentration of culture as well as of opportunity. (74) In recent years, however, people have begun to become aware that cities are also areas where there is a concentration of problems. What has happened to the modern American city? Actually, the problem is not such a new one. Long before this century started, there had begun a trend toward the concentration of the poor of the American society into the cities. Each great wave of immigration from abroad and from the rural areas made the problem worse. During this century, there has also been the development of large suburban areas surrounding the cities, for the rich prefer to live in these areas. Within the cities, sections may be sharply divided into high and low rent districts, the “right side of town” and the slums.
Of course, everyone wants to do something about this unhappy situation. But there is no agreement as to goals. Neither is there any systematic approach or integrated program. Opinions are as diverse as the people who give them. (75) But one basic difference of opinion concerns the question of whether or not the city as such is to be preserved. Perhaps transportation and the means of communication have really made it possible for there to be an end to the big cities. Of course, there is the problem of persuading people to move out of them of their own free will. (76) And there is also the objection that the city has always been the core from which cultural advancement has radiated. Is this, however, still the case today in the presence of easy transportation and communication? Does culture arise as a result of people living together communally, or is it too the result of decisions made at the level of government and the communications industry?
It is probably true to say that most people prefer to preserve the cities. Some think that the cities could be cleaned up or totally rebuilt. This is easy to say; it would not be so easy to do. (77) To be sure, a great rebuilding project would give jobs to many of those people who need them. Living conditions could not help but improve, at least for a while. But would the problems return after the rebuilding was completed?
Nevertheless, with the majority of the people living in urban areas, the problem of the cities must be solved. (78) From agreement on this general goal, we have, unfortunately, in the past proceeded to disagreement on specific goals, and from there to total inaction. At the basis of much of this inaction is an old-fashioned concept -- the idea human conditions will naturally tend to regulate themselves for the general goal.

Section II: Reading Comprehension
Each of the three passages below is followed by some questions. For each question there are four answers. Read the passages carefully and chose the best answer to each of the questions. Put your choice in the ANSWER SHEET. (20 points)
Text 1
It doesn’t come as a surprise to you to realize that it makes no difference what you read or study if you can’t remember it. You just waste your valuable time. Maybe you have already discovered some clever ways to keep yourself from forgetting.
One dependable aid that does help you remember what you study is to have a specific purpose or reason for reading. You remember better what you read when you know why you’re reading.
Why does a clerk in a store go away and leave you when your reply to her offer to help is, “No, thank you. I’m just looking”? Both you and she know that if you aren’t sure what you want, you are not likely to find it. But suppose you say instead, “Yes, thank you. I want a pair of sun glasses.” She says, “Right this way, please.” And you and she are off -- both eager to look for exactly what you want.
It’s quite the same with your studying. If you chose a book at random, “just looking” for nothing in particular, you are likely to get just that -- nothing. But if you do know what you want, and if you have the right book, you are almost sure to get it. Your reasons will vary; they will include reading or studying “to find out more about”, “to understand the reasons for”, “to find out how”. A good student has a clear purpose or reason for what he is doing.
This is the way it works. Before you start to study, you say to yourself something like this, “I want to know why Stephen Vincent Benet happened to write about America. I’m reading this article to find out.” Or, “I’m going to skim this story to see what life was like in medieval England.” Because you know why you are reading or studying, you relate the information to your purpose and remember it better.
Reading is not one single activity. At least two important processes go on at the same time. As you read, you take in ideas rapidly and accurately. But at the same time you express your own ideas to yourself as you react to what you read. You have a kind of mental conversation with the author. If you expressed your ideas orally, they might sound like this: “Yes, I agree. That’s my opinion too.” or “Ummmm, I thought that record was broken much earlier. I’d better check those dates,” or “But there are some other facts to be considered!” You don’t just sit there taking in ideas -- you do something else, and that something else is very important.
This additional process of thinking about what you read includes evaluating it, relating it to what you already know, and using it for your own purposes. In other words, a good reader is a critical reader. One part of critical reading, as you have discovered, is distinguishing between facts and opinions. Facts can be checked by evidence. Opinions are one’s own personal reactions.
Another part of critical reading is judging sources. Still another part is drawing accurate inferences.
16.	If you cannot remember what you read or study, ________.
[A] it is no surprise
[B] it means you have not really learned anything
[C] it means you have not chosen the right book
[D] you realize it is of no importance
17.	Before you start reading, it is important ________.
[A] to make sure why you are reading
[B] to relate the information to your purpose
[C] to remember what you read
[D] to choose an interesting book
18.	Reading activity involves ________.
[A] only two simultaneous processes
[B] primarily learning about ideas and evaluating them critically
[C] merely distinguishing between facts and opinions
[D] mainly drawing accurate inferences
19.	A good reader is one who ________.
[A] relates what he reads to his own knowledge about the subject matter
[B] does lots of thinking in his reading
[C] takes a critical attitude in his reading
[D] is able to check the facts presented against what he has already known
Text 2
If you live in a large city, you are quite familiar with some of the problems of noise, but because of some of its harmful effects, you may not be aware of the extent of its influence on human behavior. Although everyone more or less knows what noise is, i.e., it is sounds that one would rather not hear, it is perhaps best to define it more precisely for scientific purposes. One such definition is that noise is sounds that are unrelated to the task at hand. Thus stimuli that at one time might be considered relevant will at another time be considered noise, depending on what one is doing at the moment. In recent years there has been a great deal of interest in the effects of noise on human behavior, and concepts such as “noise pollution” have arisen, together with movements to reduce noise.
Exposure to loud noises can definitely produce a partial or complete loss of hearing, depending on the intensity, duration, and frequency composition of the noise. Many jobs present noise hazards, such as working in factories and around jet aircraft, driving farm tractors, and working (or sitting) in music halls where rock bands are playing. In general, continuous exposure to sounds of over 80 decibels (a measure of the loudness of sound) can be considered dangerous. Decibel values correspond to various sounds. Sounds above about 85 decibels may, if exposure is for a sufficient period of time, produce significant hearing loss. Actual loss will depend upon the particular frequencies to which one is exposed, and whether the sound is continuous or intermittent.
Noise can have unexpected harmful effects on performance of certain kinds of tasks, for instance, if one is performing a watch keeping task that requires vigilance, in which he is responsible for detecting weak signals of some kind (e.g., watching a radar screen for the appearance of aircraft).
Communicating with other people is unfavorably affected by noise. If you have ridden in the rear of a jet transport, you may have noticed that it was difficult to carry on a conversation at first, and that, eventually, you adjusted the loudness of your speech to compensate for the effect. The problem is noise.
20.	Noise differs from sound in that ________.
[A] it is sounds that interfere with the task being done
[B] it is a special type of loud sound
[C] it is usually unavoidable in big cities
[D] it can be defined more precisely than the latter
21.	One of the harmful effects of noise on human performance is that ________.
[A] it reduces one’s sensitivity
[B] it renders the victim helpless
[C] it deprives one of the enjoyment of music
[D] it drowns out conversations at worksites
22.	The purpose of this passage is ________.
[A] to define the effects of noise on human behavior
[B] to warn people of the danger of noise pollution
[C] to give advice as to how to prevent hearing loss
[D] to tell the difference between noise and sound
Text 3
The traditional belief that a woman’s place is in the home and that a woman ought not to go out to work can hardly be reasonably maintained in present conditions. It is said that it is a woman’s task to care for the children, but families today tend to be small and with a year or two between children. Thus a woman’s whole period of childbearing may occur within five years. Furthermore, with compulsory education from the age of five or six her role as chief educator of her children soon ceases. Thus, even if we agree that a woman should stay at home to look after her children before they are of school age, for many women, this period would extend only for about ten years.
It might be argued that the house-proud woman would still find plenty to do about the home. That may be so, but it is certainly no longer necessary for a woman to spend her whole life cooking, cleaning, mending and sewing. Washing machines take the drudgery out of laundry, the latest models being entirely automatic and able to wash and dry a large quantity of clothes in a few minutes. Refrigerators have made it possible to store food for long periods and many pre-cooked foods are obtainable in tins. Shopping, instead of being a daily task, can be completed in one day a week. The new man-made fibers are more hardwiring than natural fibers and greatly reduce mending, while good ready-made clothes are cheap and plentiful.
Apart from women’s own happiness, the needs of the community must be considered. Modern society cannot do well without the contribution that women can make in professions and other kinds of work. There is a serious shortage of nurses and teachers, to mention only two of the occupations followed by women. It is extremely wasteful to give years of training at public expense only to have the qualified teacher or nurse marry after a year or two and be lost forever to her profession. The training, it is true, will help her in duties as a mother, but if she continued to work, her service would be more widely useful.

Seated behind the front desk at a New York firm, the receptionist was efficient.
Stylishly dressed, the firm’s newest employee had a pleasant telephone voice and a natural charm that put clients at ease. The company was pleased: (61) Clearly, this was a person who took considerable pride in personal appearance. David King, the receptionist, is unusual, but by no means unique. (62) Just as all truck drivers and construction workers are no longer necessarily men, all secretaries and receptionists are no longer automatically women. The number of men in women-dominated fields is still small and they haven’t attracted the attention that has often followed women advancing into male-dominated fields, but men are moving into more and more jobs that have traditionally been held by women.
Strictly speaking, the phenomenon is not new. For the past several decades, men have been quietly entering fields such as nursing, social work and elementary education. But today no job seems off-limits. Men serve coffee in offices and meals on airplanes. (63) These changes are helping to influence some of the long-standing traditions about the types of work men and women can do -- but they also produce some undeniable problems for the men who are entering those fields formerly dominated by women.
What kinds of men venture into these so-called “women’s fields”? All kinds. (64) “I don’t know of any definite answers I’d be comfortable with,” explains Joseph Pleck, Ph.D., of the Wellesley College Centre for Research on Women.
Sam Ormont, for example, a thirty-year-old nurse at a Boston hospital, went into nursing because the army had trained him as a medical worker. (65) “I found that work very interesting.” he recalled, “and when I got out of the service it just seemed natural for me to go into something medical. I wasn’t really interested in becoming a doctor.” Thirty-five-year-old David King, an out-of-work actor, found a job as a receptionist because he was having trouble landing roles in Broadway plays and he needed to pay the rent.
(66) In other words, men enter “female” jobs out of the same consideration for personal interest and economic necessity that motivates anyone looking for work. But similarities often end there. Men in female-dominated jobs are conspicuous. As a group, their work histories differ in most respects from those of their female colleagues, and they are frequently treated differently by the people with whom they are in professional contact.
The question naturally arises: Why are there still approximately ninety-nine female secretaries for every one male? There is also a more serious issue. Most men don’t want to be receptionists, nurses, secretaries or sewing workers. Put simply, these are not generally considered very masculine jobs. (67) To choose such a line of work is to invite ridicule.
“There was kidding in the beginning,” recalls Ormont. “Kids coming from school ask what I am, and when I say ‘A nurse,’ they laugh at me. I just smile and say, ‘You know, there are female doctors, too.’”
Still, there are encouraging signs. Years ago, male grade school teachers were as rare as male nurses. Today more than one elementary school teacher in six is male.
(68) Can we anticipate a day when secretaries will be an even mix of men and women -- or when the mention of a male nurse will no longer raise eyebrows? It’s probably coming -- but not very soon.

Section II: Reading Comprehension
Each of the three passages below is followed by some questions. For each question there are four answers. Read the passages carefully and choose the best answer to each of the questions. Put your choice in the ANSWER SHEET. (20 points)
Test 1
A scientist once said: “I have concluded that the earth is being visited by intelligently controlled vehicles from outer space.”
If we take this as a reasonable explanation for UFOs (unidentified flying objects), questions immediately come up.
“Why don’t they get in touch with us, then? Why don’t they land right on the White House lawn and declare themselves?” people asked.
In reply, scientists say that, while this may be what we want, it may not necessarily be what they want.
“The most likely explanation, it seems to me,” said Dr. Mead, “is that they are simply watching what we are up to -- that responsible society outside our solar system is keeping an eye on us to see that we don’t set in motion a chain reaction that might have unexpected effects for outside our solar system.”
Opinions from other scientists might go like this: “Why should they want to get in touch with us? We may feel we’re more important than we really are! They may want to observe us only and not interfere with the development of our civilization. They may not care if we see them but they also may not care to say ‘hello’.”
Some scientists have also suggested that Earth is a kind of zoo or wildlife reserve. Just as we set aside wilderness areas and wildlife reserves to allow animals and growing things to develop naturally while we observe them, so perhaps Earth was set aside ages ago for the same purpose.
Are we being observed by intelligent beings from other civilizations in the universe? Are they watching our progress in space travel? Do we live in a gigantic “zoo” observed by our “keepers,” but having no communication with them?
Never before in our history have we had to confront ideas like these. The simple fact is that we, who have always regarded ourselves as supreme in the universe, may not be so. Now we have to recognize that, among the stars in the heavens, there may very well be worlds inhabited by beings who are to us as we are to ants.
16.	People who ask the question “Why don’t they get in touch with us... and declare themselves?” think that ________.
[A] there are no such things as UFOs
[B] UFOs are visitors from solar system
[C] there’s no reason for UFOs sooner or later
[D] we are bound to see UFOs sooner or later
17.	According to Dr. Mead, the attitude of beings from outer space toward us is one of ________.
[A] unfriendliness
[B] suspicion
[C] superiority
[D] hostility
18.	The tone of the writer is that of ________.
[A] doubt
[B] warning
[C] indifference
[D] criticism
Test 2
The use of the motor is becoming more and more widespread in the twentieth century; as an increasing number of countries develop both technically and economically, so a larger proportion of the world’s population is able to buy and use a car. Possessing a car gives a much greater degree of mobility, enabling the driver to move around freely. The owner of a car is no longer forced to rely on public transport and is, therefore, not compelled to work locally. He can choose from different jobs and probably changes his work more frequently as he is not restricted to a choice within a small radius. Travelling to work by car is also more comfortable than having to use public transport; the driver can adjust the heating in winter and the air conditioning in the summer to suit his own needs and preference. There is no irritation caused by waiting for trains, buses or underground trains, standing in long patient queues, or sitting on windy platforms, for as long as half an hour sometimes. With the building of good, fast motorways long distances can be covered rapidly and pleasantly. For the first time in this century also, many people are now able to enjoy their leisure time to the full by making trips to the country or seaside at the weekends, instead of being confined to their immediate neighbourhood. This feeling of independence, and the freedom to go where you please, is perhaps the greatest advantage of the car.
When considering the drawbacks, perhaps pollution is of prime importance. As more and more cars are produced and used, so the emission from their exhaust-pipes contains an ever larger volume of poisonous gas. Some of the contents of this gas, such as lead, not only pollute the atmosphere but cause actual harm to the health of people. Many of the minor illnesses of modern industrial society, headaches, tiredness, and stomach upsets are thought to arise from breathing polluted air; doctors’ surgeries are full of people suffering from illnesses caused by pollution. It is also becoming increasingly difficult to deal with the problem of traffic in towns; most of the important cities of the world suffer from traffic congestion. In fact any advantage gained in comfort is often cancelled out in city driving by the frustration caused by traffic jams: endless queues of cars crawling one after another through all the main streets. As an increasing number of traffic regulation schemes are devised, the poor bewildered driver finds himself diverted and forced into one-way systems which cause even greater delays than the traffic jams they are supposed to prevent. The mounting cost of petrol and the increased license fees and road tax all add to the driver’s worries. In fact, he must sometimes wonder if the motor car is such a blessing and not just a menace.
19.	More and more people can afford to buy and use cars because ________.
[A] an increasing number of cars are being produced
[B] the cost of cars is getting cheaper with the development of technology
[C] lots of countries have become more developed
[D] the use of cars has proved to be more economical
20.	The advantages of having a car are best experienced in the driver’s ________.
[A] freedom in choosing his job
[B] comfort during the travels
[C] enjoyment of his leisure time
[D] feeling of self-reliance
21.	What is considered by the writer as the greatest menace to the people caused by the widespread use of motor cars?
[A] air pollution
[B] traffic jams
[C] fatal diseases
[D] high cost
Test 3
Manners nowadays in metropolitan cities like London are practically non-existent. It is nothing for a big, strong schoolboy to elbow an elderly woman aside in the dash for the last remaining seat on the tube or bus, much less stand up and offer his seat to her, as he ought. In fact, it is saddening to note that if a man does offer his seat to an older woman, it is nearly always a Continental man or one from the older generation.
This question of giving up seats in public transport is much argued about by young men, who say that, since women have claimed equality, they no longer deserve to be treated with courtesy and that those who go out to work should take their turn in the rat race like anyone else. Women have never claimed to be physically as strong as men. Even if it is not agreed, however, that young men should stand up for younger women, the fact remains that courtesy should be shown to the old, the sick and the burdened. Are we really so lost to all ideals of unselfishness that we can sit there indifferently reading the paper or a book, saying to ourselves “First come, first served,” while a grey-haired woman, a mother with a young child or a cripple stands? Yet this is all too often seen.
Conditions in travel are really very hard on everyone, we know, but hardship is surely no excuse. Sometimes one wonders what would have been the behaviour of these stout young men in a packed refugee train or a train on its way to a prison-camp during the War. Would they have considered it only right and their proper due to keep the best places for themselves then?
Older people, tired and irritable from a day’s work, are not angels, either -- far from it. Many a brisk argument or an insulting quarrel breaks out as the weary queues push and shove each other to get on buses and tubes. One cannot commend this, of course, but one does feel there is just a little more excuse.
If cities are to remain pleasant places to live in at all, however, it seems imperative, not only that communications in transport should be improved, but also that communication between human beings should be kept smooth and polite. All over cities, it seems that people are too tired and too rushed to be polite. Shop assistants won’t bother to assist, taxi drivers growl at each other as they dash dangerously round corners, bus conductor pull the bell before their desperate passengers have had time to get on or off the bus, and so on and so on. It seems to us that it is up to the young and strong to do their small part to stop such deterioration.
22.	From what you have read, would you expect manners to improve among people ________?
[A] who are physically weak or crippled
[B] who once lived in a prison-camp during the War
[C] who live in big modern cities
[D] who live only in metropolitan cities
23.	What is the writer’s opinion concerning courteous manners towards women?
[A] Now that women have claimed equality, they no longer need to be treated differently from men.
[B] It is generally considered old-fashioned for young men to give up their seats to young women.
[C] “Lady First” should be universally practiced.
[D] Special consideration ought to be shown them.
24.	According to the author communication between human beings would be smoother if ________.
[A] people were more considerate towards each other
[B] people were not so tired and irritable
[C] women were treated with more courtesy
[D] public transport could be improved
25.	What is the possible meaning of the word “deterioration” in the last paragraph?
[A] worsening of general situation
[B] lowering of moral standards
[C] declining of physical constitution
[D] spreading of evil conduct

One day drought may be a thing of the past at least in coastal cities. Vast areas of desert throughout the world may for the first time __26__ and provide millions of hectares of land where now nothing grows.
By the end of this century this may not be mere __27__. Scientists are already looking into the possibility of using some of the available ice in the Arctic and Antarctic. In these regions there are vast ice-caps formed by snow that has fallen over the past 50,000 years. Layer __28__ layer of deep snow means that, when melted, the snow water would be pure, not salty as sea-ice would be. There is so much __29__ pure water here that it would need only a fraction of it to turn much of the desert or poorly irrigated parts of the world into rich farmland. And what useful packages it would come in! It should be possible to cut off a bit of ice and transport it! Alternatively perhaps a passing iceberg could be __30__. They are always breaking away from the main caps and floating around, pushed by currents, until they eventually melt and are wasted.
Many icebergs are, of course, far too small to be towed __31__ distance, and would melt before they reached a country that needed them anywhere. It would be necessary to locate one that was __32__ and that was big enough to provide a good supply of ice when it reached us. Engineers think that an iceberg up to seven miles long and one and a half miles wide could be transported if the tug pulling it was as big as a supertanker! Even then they would cover only twenty miles every day. However, __33__ the iceberg was at its destination, more that 7,000 million cubic metres of water could be taken from it! That would probably be more than enough for any medium-sized city even in the hottest summer! But no doubt a use could be found for it. __34__, scientist say, there would not be too much wastage in such a journey. The larger the iceberg, the slower it melts, even if it is towed through the tropics. This is because when the sun has a bigger area to warm __35__, less heat actually gets into the iceberg. The vast frozen centre would be unaffected.

Section VII: English-Chinese Translation
Read the following passage carefully and then translate the sentences in heavy type into Chinese. (20 points)
When Jane Matheson started work at Advanced Electronics Inc. 12 years ago, (61) she laboured over a microscope, hand-welding tiny electronic computers and turned out 18 per hour. Now she tends the computerized machinery that turns out high capacity memory chips at the rate of 2,600 per hour. Production is up, profits are up, her income is up and Mrs. Matheson says the work is far less strain on her eyes.
But the most significant effect of the changes at AEI was felt by the workers who are no longer there. Before the new computerized equipment was introduced, there were 940 workers at the plant. Now there are 121. (62) A plant follow-up survey showed that one year after the layoffs only 38% of the released workers found new employment at the same or better wages. Nearly half finally settled for lower pay and more than 13% are still out of work. The AEI example is only one of hundreds around the country which forge intelligently ahead into the latest technology, but leave the majority of their workers behind.
(63) Its beginnings obscured by unemployment caused by the world economic slow-down, the new technological unemployment may emerge as the great socio-economic challenge of the end of the 20th century. One corporation economist says the growth of “machine job replacement” has been with us since the beginning of the industrial revolution, but never at the pace it is now. The human costs will be astonishing. (64) “It’s humiliating to be done out of your job by a machine and there is no way to fight back, but it is the effort to find a new job that really hurts.” Some workers, like Jane Matheson, are retrained to handle the new equipment, but often a whole new set of skills is required and that means a new, and invariably smaller set of workers. (65) The old workers, trapped by their limited skills, often never regain their old status and employment. Many drift into marginal areas. They feel no pride in their new work. They get badly paid for it and they feel miserable, but still they are luckier than those who never find it.
(66) The social costs go far beyond the welfare and unemployment payments made by the government. Unemployment increases the chances of divorce, child abuse, and alcoholism, a new federal survey shows. Some experts say the problem is only temporary... that new technology will eventually create as many jobs as it destroys. (67) But futurologist Hymen Seymour says the astonishing efficiency of the new technology means there will be a simple and direct net reduction in the amount of human labor that needs to be done. “We should treat this as an opportunity to give people more leisure. It may not be easy, but society will have to reach a new unanimity on the division and distribution of labor,” Seymour says. He predicts most people will work only six-hour days and four-day weeks by the end of the century. But the concern of the unemployed is for now. (68) Federally funded training and free back-to-school programs for laid-off workers are under way, but few experts believe they will be able to keep up with the pace of the new technology. For the next few years, for a substantial portion of the workforce, times are going to be very tough indeed.

Text 1
In May l989, space shuttle “Atlantis” released in outer space the space probe “Megallan,” which is now on her 15-month and one-billion-kilometer flight to Venus. A new phase in space exploration has begun.
The planet Venus is only slightly smaller than Earth; it is the only other object in the solar system, in fact, that even comes close to earth’s size. Venus has a similar density, so it is probably made of approximately the same stuff, and it has an atmosphere, complete with clouds. It is also the closest planet to earth, and thus the most similar in distance from the sun. In short, Venus seems to justify its long-held nickname of “earth’s twin.”
The surface temperature of Venus reaches some 900F. Added to that is an atmospheric pressure about 90 times Earth’s: High overhead in the carbon dioxide (CO2) that passes for air is a layer of clouds, perhaps 10 to 20 miles thick, whose little drops consist mostly of sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Water is all but nonexistent.
Born with so many fundamental similarities to earth, how did Venus get to be so radically different: It is not just an academic matter. For all its extremes, Venus is a valuable laboratory for researchers studying the weather and climate of earth. It has no earth’s oceans, so the heat transport and other mechanisms are greatly simplified. In addition, the planet Venus takes 243 earth-days to turn once on its axis, so incoming heat from the sun is added and distributed at a more leisurely, observable pace.
16.	Venus is similar to Earth in ________.
[A] size and density
[B] distance from the sun
[C] having atmosphere
[D] all of the above
17.	The greatest value in studying Venus should be to ________.
[A] allow us to visit there
[B] understand Earth better
[C] find a new source of energy
[D] promote a new space program
18.	The main idea of this passage is about ________.
[A] problems of space travel
[B] scientific methods in space exploration
[C] the importance of Venus to Earth
[D] conditions on Venus
Text 2
Tourists were surprised to see a woman driving a huge orange tractor down one of Rome’s main avenues. Italy’s political leaders and some of its male union chiefs are said to have been even more puzzled to see that the tractor was followed by about 200,000 women in a parading procession that took more than three hours to snake through central Rome.
Shouting slogans, waving flags and dancing to drumbeats, the women had come to the capital from all over Italy to demonstrate for “a job for each of us, a different type of job, and a society without violence.” So far, action to improve women’s opportunities in employment has been the province of collective industrial bargaining. “But there is a growing awareness that this is not enough,” says a researcher on female labor at the government-funded Institute for the Development of Professional Training for Workers.
Women, who constitute 52 per cent of Italy’s population, today represent only 35 per cent of Italy’s total workforce and 33 per cent of the total number of Italians with jobs. However, their presence in the workplace is growing. The employment of women is expanding considerably in services, next to the public administration and commerce as their principal workplace. Official statistics also show that women have also made significant strides in self-employment. More and more women are going into business for themselves. Many young women are turning to business because of the growing overall in employment. It is also a fact that today many prejudices have disappeared, so that banks and other financial institutes make judgments on purely business considerations without caring if it is a man or a woman.
Such changes are occurring in the professions too. The number of women doctors, dentists, lawyers, engineers and university professors increased two to three fold. Some of the changes are immediately visible. For example, women have appeared on the scene for the first time as state police, railway workers and street cleaner.
However, the present situation is far from satisfactory though some progress has been made. A breakthrough in equal opportunities for women is now demanded.
19.	The expression “snake through central Rome” probably means “to move ________
[A] quietly through central Rome.”
[B] violently through central Rome.”
[C] in a long winding line through central Rome.”
[D] at a leisurely pace through central Rome.”
20.	Which of the following statements is NOT true?
[A] There are more women than men in Italy.
[B] In Italy, women are chiefly employed in services.
[C] In Italy, women are still at a disadvantage in employment.
[D] In Italy, about two-thirds of the jobs are held by men.
21.	About 200,000 women in Rome demonstrated for ________.
[A] more job opportunities
[B] a greater variety of jobs
[C] “equal job, equal pay”
[D] both A and B
22.	The best title for this passage would be ________.
[A] The Role of Women is Society
[B] Women Demonstrate for Equality in Employment
[C] Women as Self-employed Professionals
[D] Women and the Jobs Market
Text 3
The old idea that talented children “burn themselves out” in the early years, and, therefore, are subjected to failure and at worst, mental illness is unfounded. As a matter of fact, the outstanding thing that happens to bright kids is that they are very likely to grow into bright adults.
To find this out, l, 500 gifted persons were followed up to their thirty-fifth year with these results:
On adult intelligence tests, they scored as high as they had as children. They were, as a group, in good health, physically and mentally. 84 per cent of their group were married and seemed content with their lives.
About 70 per cent had graduated from college, though only 30 per cent had graduated with honors. A few had even dropped out, but nearly half of these had returned to graduate. Of the men, 80 per cent were in one of the professions or in business management or semiprofessional jobs. The women who had remained single had office, business, or professional occupations.
The group had published 90 books and 1,500 articles in scientific, scholarly, and literary magazines and had collected more than 100 patents.
In a material way they did not do badly either. Average income was considerably higher among the gifted people, especially the men, than for the country as a whole, despite their comparative youth.
In fact, far from being strange, most of the gifted were turning their early promise into practical reality.
23.	The old idea that talented children “burn themselves out” in the early years is ________.
[A] true in all senses
[B] refuted by the author
[C] medically proven
[D] a belief of the author
24.	The survey of bright children was made to ________.
[A] find out what had happened to talented children when they became adults
[B] prove that talented children “burn themselves out” in the early years
[C] discover the percentage of those mentally ill among the gifted
[D] prove that talented children never burn themselves out
25.	Intelligence tests showed that ________.
[A] bright children were unlikely to be mentally healthy
[B] between childhood and adulthood there was a considerable loss of intelligence
[C] talented children were most likely to become gifted adults
[D] when talented children grew into adults, they made low scores

Section VII: English-Chinese Translation
Translate the following passage carefully and then translate the sentences underlined into Chinese. (20 points)
People have wondered for a long time how their personalities and behaviors are formed. It is not easy to explain why one person is intelligent and another is not, or why one is cooperative and another is competitive.
Social scientists are, of course, extremely interested in these types of questions. (61) They want to explain why we possess certain characteristics and exhibit certain behaviors. There are no clear answers yet, but two distinct schools of thought on the matter have developed. As one might expect, the two approaches are very different from each other. The controversy is often conveniently referred to as “nature vs. nurture.”
(62) Those who support the “nature” side of the conflict believe that our personalities and behavior patterns are largely determined by biological factors. (63) That our environment has little, if anything, to do with our abilities, characteristics and behavior is central to this theory.
Taken to an extreme, this theory maintains that our behavior is pre-determined to such a great degree that we are almost completely governed by our instincts.
Those who support the “nurture” theory, that is, they advocate education, are often called behaviorists. They claim that our environment is more important than our biologically based instincts in determining how we will act. A behaviorist, B. F. Skinner, sees humans as beings whose behavior is almost completely shaped by their surroundings. (64) The behaviorists maintain that, like machines, humans respond to environmental stimuli as the basis of their behavior.
Let us examine the different explanations about one human characteristic, intelligence, offered by the two theories. (65) Supporters of the “nature” theory insist that we are born with a certain capacity for learning that is biologically determined. Needless to say: They don’t believe that factors in the environment have much influence on what is basically a predetermined characteristic. On the other hand, behaviorists argue that our intelligence levels are the product of our experiences. (66) Behaviorists suggest that the child who is raised in an environment where there are many stimuli which develop his or her capacity for appropriate responses will experience greater intellectual development.
The social and political implications of these two theories are profound. (67) In the United States, blacks often score below whites on standardized intelligence tests. This leads some “nature” proponents to conclude that blacks are biologically inferior to whites. (68) Behaviorists, in contrast, say that differences in scores are due to the fact that blacks are often deprived of many of the educational and other environmental advantages that whites enjoy.
Most people think neither of these theories can yet fully explain human behavior.

Section II: Reading Comprehension
Each of the passages below is followed by some questions. For ach question four answers are given. Read the passages carefully and choose the best answer to each of the questions. Put your choice in the ANSWER SHEET. (30 points)
Text l
A wise man once said that the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. So, as a police officer, I have some urgent things to say to good people.
Day after day my men and I struggle to hold back a tidal wave of crime. Something has gone terribly wrong with our once-proud American way of life. It has happened in the area of values. A key ingredient is disappearing, and I think I know what it is: accountability.
Accountability isn’t hard to define. It means that every person is responsible for his or her actions and liable for their consequences.
Of the many values that hold civilization together -- honesty, kindness, and so on -- accountability may be the most important of all. Without it, there can be no respect, no trust, no law -- and, ultimately, no society.
My job as a police officer is to impose accountability on people who refuse, or have never learned, to impose it on themselves. But as every policeman knows, external controls on people’s behavior are far less effective than internal restraints such as guilt, shame and embarrassment.
Fortunately there are still communities -- smaller towns, usually -- where schools maintain discipline and where parents hold up standards that proclaim: “In this family certain things are not tolerated -- they simply are not done!”
Yet more and more, especially in our larger cities and suburbs, these inner restraints are loosening. Your typical robber has none. He considers your property his property; he takes what he wants, including your life if you enrage him.
The main cause of this break-down is a radical shift in attitudes. Thirty years ago, if a crime was committed, society was considered the victim. Now, in a shocking reversal, it’s the criminal who is considered victimized: by his underprivileged upbringing, by the school that didn’t teach him to read, by the church that failed to reach him with moral guidance, by the parents who didn’t provide a stable home.
I don’t believe it. Many others in equally disadvantaged circumstances choose not to engage in criminal activities. If we free the criminal, even partly, from accountability, we become a society of endless excuses where no one accepts responsibility for anything.
We in America desperately need more people who believe that the person who commits a crime is the one responsible for it.
31.	What the wise man said suggests that ________.
[A] it’s unnecessary for good people to do anything in face of evil
[B] it’s certain that evil will prevail if good men do nothing about it
[C] it’s only natural for virtue to defeat evil
[D] it’s desirable for good men to keep away from evil
32.	According to the author, if a person is found guilty of a crime, ________.
[A] society is to be held responsible
[B] modern civilization is responsible for it
[C] the criminal himself should bear the blame
[D] the standards of living should be improved
33.	Compared with those in small towns, people in large cities have ________.
[A] less self-discipline
[B] better sense of discipline
[C] more mutual respect
[D] less effective government
34.	The writer is sorry to have noticed that ________.
[A] people in large cities tend to excuse criminals
[B] people in small towns still stick to old discipline and standards
[C] today’s society lacks sympathy for people in difficulty
[D] people in disadvantaged circumstances are engaged in criminal activities
35.	The key point of the passage is that ________.
[A] stricter discipline should be maintained in schools and families
[B] more good examples should be set for people to follow
[C] more restrictions should be imposed on people’s behavior
[D] more people should accept the value of accountability
Text 2
The period of adolescence, i.e., the period between childhood and adulthood, may be long or short, depending on social expectations and on society’s definition as to what constitutes maturity and adulthood. In primitive societies adolescence is frequently a relatively short period of time, while in industrial societies with patterns of prolonged education coupled with laws against child labor, the period of adolescence is much longer and may include most of the second decade of one’s life. Furthermore, the length of the adolescent period and the definition of adulthood status may change in a given society as social and economic conditions change. Examples of this type of change are the disappearance of the frontier in the latter part of the nineteenth century in the United States, and more universally, the industrialization of an agricultural society.
In modern society, ceremonies for adolescence have lost their formal recognition and symbolic significance and there no longer is agreement as to what constitutes initiation ceremonies. Social ones have been replaced by a sequence of steps that lead to increased recognition and social status. For example, grade school graduation, high school graduation and college graduation constitute such a sequence, and while each step implies certain behavioral changes and social recognition, the significance of each depends on the socio-economic status and the educational ambition of the individual. Ceremonies for adolescence have also been replaced by legal definitions of status roles, right, privileges and responsibilities. It is during the nine years from the twelfth birthday to the twenty-first that the protective and restrictive aspects of childhood and minor status are removed and adult privileges and responsibilities are granted. The twelve-year-old is no longer considered a child and has to pay full fare for train, airplane, theater and movie tickets. Basically, the individual at this age loses childhood privileges without gaining significant adult rights. At the age of sixteen the adolescent is granted certain adult rights which increases his social status by providing him with more freedom and choices. He now can obtain a driver’s license; he can leave public schools; and he can work without the restrictions of child labor laws. At the age of eighteen the law provides adult responsibilities as well as rights; the young man can now be a soldier, but he also can marry without parental permission. At the age of twenty-one the individual obtains his full legal rights as an adult. He now can vote, he can buy liquor, he can enter into financial contracts, and he is entitled to run for public office. No additional basic rights are acquired as a function of age after majority status has been attained. None of these legal provisions determine at what point adulthood has been reached but they do point to the prolonged period of adolescence.
36.	The period of adolescence is much longer in industrial societies because ________.
[A] the definition of maturity has changed
[B] the industrialized society is more developed
[C] more education is provided and laws against child labor are made
[D] ceremonies for adolescence have lost their formal recognition and symbolic significance
37.	Former social ceremonies that used to mark adolescence have given place to ________.
[A] graduations from schools and colleges
[B] social recognition
[C] socio-economic status
[D] certain behavioral changes
38.	No one can expect to fully enjoy the adulthood privileges until he is ________.
[A] eleven years old
[B] sixteen years old
[C] twenty-one years old
[D] between twelve and twenty-one years old
39.	Starting from 22, ________.
[A] one will obtain more basic rights
[B] the older one becomes, the more basic rights he will have
[C] one won’t get more basic rights than when he is 21
[D] one will enjoy more rights granted by society
40.	According to the passage, it is true that ________.
[A] in the late 19th century in the United States the dividing line between adolescence and adulthood no longer existed
[B] no one can marry without the permission of his parents until the age of twenty-one
[C] one is considered to have reached adulthood when he has a driver’s license
[D] one is not free from the restrictions of child labor laws until he can join the army
Text 3
Most growing plants contain much more water than all other materials combined. C. R. Darnes has suggested that it is as proper to term the plant a water structure as to call a house composed mainly of brick -- a brick building. Certain it is that all essential processes of plant growth and development occur in water. The mineral elements from the soil that are usable by the plant must be dissolved in the soil solution before they can be taken into the root. They are carried to all parts of the growing plant and are built into essential plant materials while in a dissolved state. The carbon dioxide from the air may enter the leaf as a gas but is dissolved in water in the leaf before it is combined with a part of the water to form simple sugars -- the base material from which the plant body is mainly built. Actively growing plant parts are generally 75 to 90 percent water. Structural parts of plants, such as woody stems no longer actively growing, may have much less water than growing tissues.
The actual amount of water in the plant at any one time, however, is only a very small part of what passes through it during its development. The processes of photosynthesis, by which carbon dioxide and water are combined -- in the presence of chlorophyll (叶绿素) and with energy derived from light -- to form sugars, require that carbon dioxide from the air enter the plant. This occurs mainly in the leaves. The leaf surface is not solid but contains great numbers of minute openings, through which the carbon dioxide enters. The same structure that permits the one gas to enter the leaf, however, permits another gas -- water vapor -- to be lost from it. Since carbon dioxide is present in the air only in trace quantities (3 to 4 parts in 10,000 parts of air) and water vapor is near saturation in the air spaces within the leaf (at 80F, saturated air would contain about 186 parts of water vapor in 10,000 parts of air), the total amount of water vapor lost is many times the carbon dioxide intake. Actually, because of wind and other factors, the loss of water in proportion to carbon dioxide intake may be even greater than the relative concentrations of the two gases. Also, not all of the carbon dioxide that enters the leaf is synthesized into carbohydrates (碳水化合物).
41.	A growing plant needs water for all of the following except ________.
[A] forming sugars
[B] sustaining woody stems
[C] keeping green
[D] producing carbon dioxide
42.	The essential function of photosynthesis in terms of plant needs is ________.
[A] to form sugars
[B] to derive energy from light
[C] to preserve water
[D] to combine carbon dioxide with water
43.	The second paragraph uses facts to develop the essential idea that ________.
[A] a plant efficiently utilizes most of the water it absorbs
[B] carbon dioxide is the essential substance needed for plant development
[C] a plant needs more water than is found in its composition
[D] the stronger the wind, the more the water vapor loss
44.	According to the passage, which of the following statements is TRUE?
[A] The mineral elements will not be absorbed by the plant unless they are dissolved in its root.
[B] The woody stems contain more water than the leaves.
[C] Air existing around the leaf is found to be saturated.
[D] Only part of the carbon dioxide in the plants is synthesized.
45.	This passage is mainly about ________.
[A] the functions of carbon dioxide and water
[B] the role of water in a growing plant
[C] the process of simple sugar formation
[D] the synthesis of water with carbon dioxide

Section V: English-Chinese Translation
Read the following passage carefully and then translate the underlined sentences into Chinese. (15 points)
The fact is that the energy crisis, which has suddenly been officially announced, has been with us for a long time now, and will be with us for an even longer time. Whether Arab oil flows freely or not, it is clear to everyone that world industry cannot be allowed to depend on so fragile a base. (71) The supply of oil can be shut off unexpectedly at any time, and in any case, the oil wells will all run dry in thirty years or so at the present rate of use. (72) New sources of energy must be found, and this will take time, but it is not likely to result in any situation that will ever restore that sense of cheap and plentiful energy we have had in the times past. For an indefinite period from here on, mankind is going to advance cautiously, and consider itself lucky that it can advance at all.
To make the situation worse, there is as yet no sign that any slowing of the world’s population is in sight. Although the birth-rate has dropped in some nations, including the United States, the population of the world seems sure to pass six billion and perhaps even seven billion as the twenty-first century opens.
(73) The food supply will not increase nearly enough to match this, which means that we are heading into a crisis in the matter of producing and marketing food.
Taking all this into account, what might we reasonably estimate supermarkets to be like in the year 2001?
To begin with, the world food supply is going to become steadily tighter over the next thirty years -- even here in the United States. By 2001, the population of the United States will be at least two hundred fifty million and possibly two hundred seventy million, and the nation will find it difficult to expand food production to fill the additional mouths. (74) This will be particularly true since energy pinch will make it difficult to continue agriculture in the high-energy American fashion that makes it possible to combine few farmers with high yields.
It seems almost certain that by 200l the United States will no longer be a great food-exporting nation and that, if necessity forces exports, it will be at the price of belt-tightening at home.
In fact, as food items will tend to decline in quality and decrease in variety, there is very likely to be increasing use of flavouring additives. (75) Until such time as mankind has the sense to lower its population to the point where the planet can provide a comfortable support for all, people will have to accept more “unnatural food”.

Section II: Reading Comprehension
Each of the passages below is followed by some questions. For each question four answers are given. Read the passage carefully and choose the best answer to each of the questions. Put your choice in the ANSWER SHEET. (30 points)
Text 1
It is all very well to blame traffic jams, the cost of petrol and the quick pace of modern life, but manners on the roads are becoming horrible. Everybody knows that the nicest men become monsters behind the wheel. It is very well, again, to have a tiger in the tank, but to have one in the driver’s seat is another matter altogether. You might tolerate the odd road-hog, the rude and inconsiderate driver, but nowadays the well-mannered motorist is the exception to the rule. Perhaps the situation calls for a ‘Be Kind to Other Drivers’ campaign, otherwise it may get completely out of hand.
Road politeness is not only good manners, but good sense too. It takes the most cool-headed and good-tempered of drivers to resist the temptation to revenge when subjected to uncivilized behavior. On the other hand, a little politeness goes a long way towards relieving the tensions of motoring. A friendly nod or a wave of acknowledgement in response to an act of politeness helps to create an atmosphere of goodwill and tolerance so necessary in modern traffic conditions. But such acknowledgements of politeness are all too rare today. Many drivers nowadays don’t even seem able to recognize politeness when they see it.
However, misplaced politeness can also be dangerous. Typical examples are the driver who brakes violently to allow a car to emerge from a side street at some hazard to following traffic, when a few seconds later the road would be clear anyway; or the man who waves a child across a zebra crossing into the path of oncoming vehicles that may be unable to stop in time. The same goes for encouraging old ladies to cross the road wherever and whenever they care to. It always amazes me that the highways are not covered with the dead bodies of these grannies.
A veteran driver, whose manners are faultless, told me it would help if motorists learnt to filter correctly into traffic streams one at a time without causing the total blockages that give rise to bad temper. Unfortunately, modern motorists can’t even learn to drive, let alone master the subtler aspects of boatmanship. Years ago the experts warned us that the car-ownership explosion would demand a lot more give-and-take from all road users. It is high time for all of us to take this message to heart.
31.	According to this passage, troubles on the road are primarily caused by ________.
[A] people’s attitude towards the road-hog
[B] the rhythm of modern life
[C] the behavior of the driver
[D] traffic conditions
32.	The sentence “You might tolerate the odd road-hog... the rule.” (Para. 1) implies that ________.
[A] our society is unjust towards well-mannered motorists
[B] rude drivers can be met only occasionally
[C] the well-mannered motorist cannot tolerate the road-hog
[D] nowadays impolite drivers constitute the majority of motorists
33.	By “good sense,” the writer means ________.
[A] the driver’s ability to understand and react reasonably
[B] the driver’s prompt response to difficult and severe conditions
[C] the driver’s tolerance of rude or even savage behavior
[D] the driver’s acknowledgement of politeness and regulations
34.	Experts have long pointed out that in the face of car-ownership explosion, ________.
[A] road users should make more sacrifice
[B] drivers should be ready to yield to each other
[C] drivers should have more communication among themselves
[D] drivers will suffer great loss if they pay no respect to others
35.	In the writer’s opinion, ________.
[A] strict traffic regulations are badly needed
[B] drivers should apply road politeness properly
[C] rude drivers should be punished
[D] drivers should avoid traffic jams

In the atmosphere, carbon dioxide acts rather like a one-way mirror -- the glass in the roof of a greenhouse which allows the sun’s rays to enter but prevents the heat from escaping.
According to a weather expert’s prediction, the atmosphere will be 3℃ warmer in the year 2050 than it is today, if man continues to burn fuels at the present rate. If this warming up took place, the ice caps in the poles would begin to melt, thus raising sea level several metres and severely flooding coastal cities. Also, the increase in atmospheric temperature would lead to great changes in the climate of the northern hemisphere, possibly resulting in an alteration of earth’s chief food-growing zones.
In the past, concern about a man-made warming of the earth has concentrated on the Arctic because the Antarctic is much colder and has a much thicker ice sheet. But the weather experts are now paying more attention to West Antarctic, which may be affected by only a few degrees of warming, in other words, by a warming on the scale that will possibly take place in the next fifty years from the burning of fuels.
Satellite pictures show that large areas of Antarctic ice are already disappearing. The evidence available suggests that a warming has taken place. This fits the theory that carbon dioxide warms the earth.
However, most of the fuel is burnt in the northern hemisphere, where temperatures seem to be falling. Scientists conclude, therefore, that up to now natural influences on the weather have exceeded those caused by man. The question is: Which natural cause has most effect on the weather?
One possibility is the variable behavior of the sun. Astronomers at one research station have studied the hot spots and “cold” spots (that is, the relatively less hot spots) on the sun. As the sun rotates, every 27.5 days, it presents hotter or “colder” faces to the earth, and different aspects to different parts of the earth. This seems to have a considerable effect on the distribution of the earth’s atmospheric pressure, and consequently on wind circulation. The sun is also variable over a long term: its heat output goes up and down in cycles, the latest trend being downward.
Scientists are now finding mutual relations between models of solar-weather interactions and the actual climate over many thousands of years, including the last Ice Age. The problem is that the models are predicting that the world should be entering a new Ice Age and it is not. One way of solving this theoretical difficulty is to assume a delay of thousands of years while the solar effects overcome the inertia (惯性) of the earth’s climate. If this is right, the warming effect of carbon dioxide might thus be serving as a useful counter-balance to the sun’s diminishing heat.
36.	It can be concluded that a concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would ________.
[A] prevent the sun’s rays from leeching the earth’s surface
[B] mean a warming up in the Arctic
[C] account for great changes in the climate in the northern hemisphere
[D] raise the temperature of the earth’s surface
37.	The article was written to explain ________.
[A] the greenhouse effect
[B] the solar effects on the earth
[C] the models of solar-weather interactions
[D] the causes affecting weather
38.	Although the fuel consumption is greater in the northern hemisphere, temperatures there seem to be falling. This is ________.
[A] mainly because the levels of carbon dioxide are rising
[B] possibly because the ice caps in the poles are melting
[C] exclusively due to the effect of the inertia of the earth’s climate
[D] partly due to variations in the output of solar energy
39.	On the basis of their models, scientists are of the opinion that ________.
[A] the climate of the world should be becoming cooler
[B] it will take thousands of years for the inertia of the earth’s climate to take effect
[C] the man-made warming effect helps to increase the solar effects
[D] the new Ice Age will be delayed by the greenhouse effect
40.	If the assumption about the delay of a new Ice Age is correct, ________.
[A] the best way to overcome the cooling effect would be to burn more fuels
[B] ice would soon cover the northern hemisphere
[C] the increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could warm up the earth even more quickly
[D] the greenhouse effect could work to the advantage of the earth

Some people believe that international sport creates goodwill between the nations and that if countries play games together they will learn to live together. Others say that the opposite is true: that international contests encourage false national pride and lead to misunderstanding and hatred. There is probably some truth in both arguments, but in recent years the Olympic Games have done little to support the view that sports encourages international brotherhood. Not only was there the tragic incident involving the murder of athletes, but the Games were also ruined by lesser incidents caused principally by minor national contests.
One country received its second-place medals with visible indignation after the hockey (曲棍球) final. There had been noisy scenes at the end of the hockey match, the losers objecting to the final decisions. They were convinced that one of their goals should not have been disallowed and that their opponents’ victory was unfair. Their manager was in a rage when he said: “This wasn’t hockey. Hockey and the International Hockey Federation are finished.” The president of the Federation said later that such behavior could result in the suspension of the team for at least three years.
The American basketball team announced that they would not yield first place to Russia, after a disputable end to their contest. The game had ended in disturbance. It was thought at first that the United States had won, by a single point, but it was announced that there were three seconds still to play. A Russian player then threw the ball from one end of the court to the other, and another player popped it into the basket. It was the first time the USA had ever lost an Olympic basketball match. An appeal jury debated the matter for four and a half hours before announcing that the result would stand. The American players then voted not to receive the silver medals.
Incidents of this kind will continue as long as sport is played competitively rather than for the love of the game. The suggestion that athletes should compete as individuals, or in non-national teams, might be too much to hope for. But in the present organization of the Olympics there is far too much that encourages aggressive patriotism.
41.	According to the author, recent Olympic Games have ________.
[A] created goodwill between the nations
[B] bred only false national pride
[C] barely showed any international friendship
[D] led to more and more misunderstanding and hatred
42.	What did the manager mean by saying, “... Hockey and the International Hockey Federation are finished”?
[A] His team would no longer take part in international games.
[B] Hockey and the Federation are both ruined by the unfair decisions.
[C] There should be no more hockey matches organized by the Federation.
[D] The Federation should be dissolved.
43.	The basketball example implied that ________.
[A] too much patriotism was displayed in the incident
[B] the announcement to prolong the match was wrong
[C] the appeal jury was too hesitant in making the decision
[D] the American team was right in rejecting the silver medals
44.	The author gives the two examples in paragraphs 2 and 3 to show ________.
[A] how false national pride led to undesirable incidents in international games
[B] that sportsmen have been more obedient than they used to be
[C] that competitiveness in the games discourages international friendship
[D] that unfair decisions are common in Olympic Games
45.	What conclusion can be drawn from the passage?
[A] The organization of the Olympic Games must be improved.
[B] Athletes should compete as individual in the Olympic Games.
[C] Sport should be played competitively rather than for the love of the game.
[D] International contests are liable for misunderstanding between nations.

Section V: English-Chinese Translation
Read the following passage carefully and then translate the underlined sentences into Chinese. (15 points)
Intelligence at best is an assumptive construct -- the meaning of the word has never been clear. (71) There is more agreement on the kinds of behavior referred to by the term than there is on how to interpret or classify them. But it is generally agreed that a person of high intelligence is one who can grasp ideas readily, make distinctions, reason logically, and make use of verbal and mathematical symbols in solving problems. An intelligence test is a rough measure of a child’s capacity for learning, particularly for learning the kinds of things required in school. It does not measure character, social adjustment, physical endurance, manual skills, or artistic abilities. It is not supposed to -- it was not designed for such purposes. (72) To criticize it for such failure is roughly comparable to criticizing a thermometer for not measuring wind velocity.
The other thing we have to notice is that the assessment of the intelligence of any subject is essentially a comparative affair.
(73) Now since the assessment of intelligence is a comparative matter we must be sure that the scale with which we are comparing our subjects provides a ‘valid’ or ‘fair’ comparison. It is here that some of the difficulties which interest us begin. Any test performed involves at least three factors: the intention to do one’s best, the knowledge required for understanding what you have to do, and the intellectual ability to do it. (74) The first two must be equal for all who are being compared, if any comparison in terms of intelligence is to be made. In school populations in our culture these assumptions can be made fair and reasonable, and the value of intelligence testing has been proved thoroughly. Its value lies, of course, in its providing a satisfactory basis for prediction. No one is in the least interested in the marks a little child gets on his test; what we are interested in is whether we can conclude from his mark on the test that the child will do better or worse than other children of his age at tasks which we think require ‘general intelligence’.
(75) On the whole such a conclusion can be drawn with a certain degree of confidence, but only if the child can be assumed to have had the same attitude towards the test as the others with whom he is being compared, and only if he was not punished by lack of relevant information which they possessed.

For A Better Understanding Between Parent And Child
Nowadays, there is often a lack of understanding between parent and child. One generation often feels that its style of life is different from another generation’s style. The feeling that each family unit should have a separate residence is characteristic. No one wants to intrude or be intruded upon. Both parents and child feel that the other’s presence would upset and change the normal routine.
One of the reasons for present situation is that there are different likes and dislikes between parents and child. For example, the child likes glittering disco, rock-and-roll music or loves movies for his entertainment at night while the parents like peaceful environment and physical exercises. They would like to spend their evenings of life in happiness.
Secondly, there often exists misunderstanding between parent and child. The child doesn’t know what his parent thinks and acts, while the parent doesn’t understand what his children want to do. In general, young people enjoy a great deal of freedom, while their parents always keep their traditional style of life.
Thirdly, children often do not feel an equal share of responsibility toward their parents. For example, a brother sometimes feels that his sisters are responsible for physical care of their parents. One child may resent another’s reluctance to help, provoking misunderstanding and bitterness. Not all of the children may be financially capable of contributing an equal share to the cost of their parent’s care.
I argue that it is unfair to say that they are self-centered. Parent and child should often communicate each other. By discovering things about both sides, they can interact much better and help each other to deal with their problems for a better understanding between parents and child.

Text 1
Is language, like food, a basic human need without which a child at a critical period of life can be starved and damaged? Judging from the drastic experiment of Frederick II in the thirteenth century, it may be. Hoping to discover what language a child would speak if he heard no mother tongue, he told the nurses to keep silent.
All the infants died before the first year. But clearly there was more than lack of language here. What was missing was good mothering. Without good mothering, in the first year of life especially, the capacity to survive is seriously affected.
Today no such severe lack exists as that ordered by Frederick. Nevertheless, some children are still backward in speaking. Most often the reason for this is that the mother is insensitive to the signals of the infant, whose brain is programmed to learn language rapidly. If these sensitive periods are neglected, the ideal time for acquiring skills passes and they might never be learned so easily again. A bird learns to sing and to fly rapidly at the right time, but the process is slow and hard once the critical stage has passed.
Experts suggest that speech stages are reached in a fixed sequence and at a constant age, but there are cases where speech has started late in a child who eventually turns out to be of high IQ. At twelve weeks a baby smiles and makes vowel-like sounds; at twelve months he can speak simple words and understand simple commands; at eighteen months he has a vocabulary of three to fifty words. At three he knows about 1,000 words which he can put into sentences, and at four his language differs from that of his parents in style rather than grammar.
Recent evidence suggests that an infant is born with the capacity to speak. What is special about man’s brain, compared with that of the monkey, is the complex system which enables a child to connect the sight and feel of, say, a toy-bear with the sound pattern “toy-bear.” And even more incredible is the young brain’s ability to pick out an order in language from the mixture of sound around him, to analyze, to combine and recombine the parts of a language in new ways.
But speech has to be induced, and this depends on interaction between the mother and the child, where the mother recognizes the signals in the child’s babbling (咿呀学语), grasping and smiling, and responds to them. Insensitivity of the mother to these signals dulls the interaction because the child gets discouraged and sends out only the obvious signals. Sensitivity to the child’s non-verbal signals is essential to the growth and development of language.
31.	The purpose of Frederick II’s experiment was ________.
[A] to prove that children are born with the ability to speak
[B] to discover what language a child would speak without hearing any human speech
[C] to find out what role careful nursing would play in teaching a child to speak
[D] to prove that a child could be damaged without learning a language
32.	The reason some children are backward in speaking is most probably that ________.
[A] they are incapable of learning language rapidly
[B] they are exposed to too much language at once
[C] their mothers respond inadequately to their attempts to speak
[D] their mothers are not intelligent enough to help them
33.	What is exceptionally remarkable about a child is that ________.
[A] he is born with the capacity to speak
[B] he has a brain more complex than an animal’s
[C] he can produce his own sentences
[D] he owes his speech ability to good nursing
34.	Which of the following can NOT be inferred from the passage?
[A] The faculty of speech is inborn in man.
[B] Encouragement is anything but essential to a child in language learning.
[C] The child’s brain is highly selective.
[D] Most children learn their language in definite stages.
35.	If a child starts to speak later than others, he will ________.
[A] have a high IQ

[D] not necessarily be backward
Text 2
In general, our society is becoming one of giant enterprises directed by a bureaucratic (官僚主义的) management in which man becomes a small, well-oiled cog in the machinery. The oiling is done with higher wages, well-ventilated factories and piped music, and by psychologists and “human-relations” experts; yet all this oiling does not alter the fact that man has become powerless, that he does not wholeheartedly participate in his work and that he is bored with it. In fact, the blue- and the white-collar workers have become economic puppets who dance to the tune of automated machines and bureaucratic management.
The worker and employee are anxious, not only because they might find themselves out of a job; they are anxious also because they are unable to acquire any real satisfaction or interest in life. They live and die without ever having confronted the fundamental realities of human existence as emotionally and intellectually independent and productive human beings.
Those higher up on the social ladder are no less anxious. Their lives are no less empty than those of their subordinates. They are even more insecure in some respects. They are in a highly competitive race. To be promoted or to fall behind is not a matter of salary but even more a matter of self-respect. When they apply for their first job, they are tested for intelligence as well as for the tight mixture of submissiveness and independence. From that moment on they are tested again and again -- by the psychologists, for whom testing is a big business, and by their superiors, who judge their behavior, sociability, capacity to get along, etc. This constant need to prove that one is as good as or better than one’s fellow-competitor creates constant anxiety and stress, the very causes of unhappiness and illness.
Am I suggesting that we should return to the preindustrial mode of production or to nineteenth-century “free enterprise” capitalism? Certainly not. Problems are never solved by returning to a stage which one has already outgrown. I suggest transforming our social system from a bureaucratically managed industrialism in which maximal production and consumption are ends in themselves into a humanist industrialism in which man and full development of his potentialities -- those of love and of reason -- are the aims of all social arrangements. Production and consumption should serve only as means to this end, and should be prevented from ruling man.
36.	By “a well-oiled cog in the machinery” the author intends to render the idea that man is ________.
[A] a necessary part of the society though each individual’s function is negligible
[B] working in complete harmony with the rest of the society
[C] an unimportant part in comparison with the rest of the society, though functioning smoothly
[D] a humble component of the society, especially when working smoothly
37.	The real cause of the anxiety of the workers and employees is that ________.
[A] they are likely to lose their jobs
[B] they have no genuine satisfaction or interest in life
[C] they are faced with the fundamental realities of human existence
[D] they are deprived of their individuality and independence
38.	From the passage we can infer that real happiness of life belongs to those ________.
[A] who are at the bottom of the society
[B] who are higher up in their social status
[C] who prove better than their fellow-competitors
[D] who could keep far away from this competitive world
39.	To solve the present social problems the author suggests that we should ________.
[A] resort to the production mode of our ancestors
[B] offer higher wages to the workers and employees
[C] enable man to fully develop his potentialities
[D] take the fundamental realities for granted
40.	The author’s attitude towards industrialism might best be summarized as one of ________.
[A] approval
[B] dissatisfaction
[C] suspicion
[D] tolerance
Text 3
When an invention is made, the inventor has three possible courses of action open to him: he can give the invention to the world by publishing it, keep the idea secret, or patent it.
A granted patent is the result of a bargain struck between an inventor and the state, by which the inventor gets a limited period of monopoly (垄断) and publishes full details of his invention to the public after that period terminates.
Only in the most exceptional circumstances is the lifespan of a patent extended to alter this normal process of events.
The longest extension ever granted was to Georges Valensi; his 1939 patent for color TV receiver circuitry was extended until 1971 because for most of the patent’s normal life there was no colour TV to receive and thus no hope of reward for the invention. 
Because a patent remains permanently public after it has terminated, the shelves of the library attached to the patent office contain details of literally millions of ideas that are free for anyone to use and, if older than half a century, sometimes even re-patent. Indeed, patent experts often advise anyone wishing to avoid the high cost of conducting a search through live patents that the one sure way of avoiding violation of any other inventor’s right is to plagiarize a dead patent.
Likewise, because publication of an idea in any other form permanently invalidates further patents on that idea, it is traditionally safe to take ideas from other areas of print. Much modern technological advance is based on these presumptions of legal security.
Anyone closely involved in patents and inventions soon learns that most “new” ideas are, in fact, as old as the hills. It is their reduction to commercial practice, either through necessity or dedication, or through the availability of new technology, that makes news and money. The basic patent for the theory of magnetic recording dates back to 1886. Many of the original ideas behind television originate from the late 19th and early 20th century. Even the Volkswagen rear engine car was anticipated by a 1904 patent for a cart with the horse at the rear.
41.	The passage is mainly about ________.
[A] an approach to patents
[B] the application for patents
[C] the use of patents
[D] the access to patents
42.	Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?
[A] When a patent becomes out of effect, it can be re-patented or extended if necessary.
[B] It is necessary for an inventor to apply for a patent before he makes his invention public.
[C] A patent holder must publicize the details of his invention when its legal period is over.
[D] One can get all the details of a patented invention from a library attached to the patent office.
43.	George Valensi’s patent lasted until 1971 because ________.
[A] nobody would offer any reward for his patent prior to that time
[B] his patent could not be put to use for an unusually long time
[C] there were not enough TV stations to provide colour programmes
[D] the colour TV receiver was not available until that time
44.	The word “plagiarize” (line 8, Para. 5) most probably means “________.”
[A] steal and use
[B] give reward to
[C] make public
[D] take and change
45.	From the passage we learn that ________.
[A] an invention will not benefit the inventor unless it is reduced to commercial practice
[B] products are actually inventions which were made a long time ago
[C] it is much cheaper to buy an old patent than a new one
[D] patent experts often recommend patents to others by conducting a search through dead patents

Section V: English-Chinese Translation
Read the following passage carefully and then translate the underlined sentences into Chinese. (15 points)
(71) The method of scientific investigation is nothing but the expression of the necessary mode of working of the human mind; it is simply the mode by which all phenomena are reasoned about and given precise and exact explanation. There is no more difference, but there is just the same kind of difference, between the mental operations of a man of science and those of an ordinary person, as there is between the operations and methods of a baker or of a butcher weighing out his goods in common scales, and the operations of a chemist in performing a difficult and complex analysis by means of his balance and finely graded weights. (72) It is not that the scales in the one case, and the balance in the other, differ in the principles of their construction or manner of working; but that the latter is a much finer apparatus and of course much more accurate in its measurement than the former.
You will understand this better, perhaps, if I give you some familiar examples. (73) You have all heard it repeated that men of science work by means of induction (归纳法) and deduction, that by the help of these operations, they, in a sort of sense, manage to extract from Nature certain natural laws, and that out of these, by some special skill of their own, they build up their theories. (74) And it is imagined by many that the operations of the common mind can be by no means compared with these processes, and that they have to be acquired by a sort of special training. To hear all these large words, you would think that the mind of a man of science must be constituted differently from that of his fellow men; but if you will not be frightened by terms, you will discover that you are quite wrong, and that all these terrible apparatus are being used by yourselves every day and every hour of your lives.
There is a well-known incident in one of Motiere’s plays, where the author makes the hero express unbounded delight on being told that he had been talking prose (散文) during the whole of his life. In the same way, I trust that you will take comfort, and be delighted with yourselves, on the discovery that you have been acting on the principles of inductive and deductive philosophy during the same period. (75) Probably there is not one here who has not in the course of the day had occasion to set in motion a complex train of reasoning, of the very same kind, though differing in degree, as that which a scientific man goes through in tracing the causes of natural phenomena.

Text 1
The American economic system is organized around a basically private-enterprise, market-oriented economy in which consumers largely determine what shall be produced by spending their money in the marketplace for those goods and services that they want most. Private businessmen, striving to make profits, produce these goods and services in competition with other businessmen; and the profit motive, operating under competitive pressures, largely determines how these goods and services are produced. Thus, in the American economic system it is the demand of individual consumers, coupled with the desire of businessmen to maximize profits and the desire of individuals to maximize their incomes, that together determine what shall be produced and how resources are used to produce it.
An important factor in a market-oriented economy is the mechanism by which consumer demands can be expressed and responded to by producers. In the American economy, this mechanism is provided by a price system, a process in which prices rise and fall in response to relative demands of consumers and supplies offered by seller-producers. If the product is in short supply relative to the demand, the price will be bid up and some consumers will be eliminated from the market. If, on the other hand, producing more of a commodity results in reducing its cost, this will tend to increase the supply offered by seller-producers, which in turn will lower the price and permit more consumers to buy the product. Thus, price is the regulating mechanism in the American economic system.
The important factor in a private-enterprise economy is that individuals are allowed to own productive resources (private property), and they are permitted to hire labor, gain control over natural resources, and produce goods and services for sale at a profit. In the American economy, the concept of private property embraces not only the ownership of productive resources but also certain rights, including the right to determine the price of a product or to make a free contract with another private individual.
51.	In Line 11, Paragraph 1, “the desire of individuals to maximize their incomes” means ________.
[A] Americans are never satisfied with their incomes
[B] Americans tend to overstate their incomes
[C] Americans want to have their incomes increased
[D] Americans want to increase the purchasing power of their incomes
52.	The first two sentences in the second paragraph tell us that ________.
[A] producers can satisfy the consumers by mechanized production
[B] consumers can express their demands through producers
[C] producers decide the prices of products
[D] supply and demand regulate prices
53.	According to the passage, a private-enterprise economy is characterized by ________.
[A] private property and rights concerned
[B] manpower and natural resources control
[C] ownership of productive resources
[D] free contracts and prices
54.	The passage is mainly about ________.
[A] how American goods are produced
[B] how American consumers buy their goods
[C] how American economic system works
[D] how American businessmen make their profits

One hundred and thirteen million Americans have at least one bank-issued credit card. They give their owners automatic credit in stores, restaurants, and hotels, at home, across the country, and even abroad, and they make many banking services available as well. More and more of these credit cards can be read automatically, making it possible to withdraw or deposit money in scattered locations, whether or not the local branch bank is open. For many of us the “cashless society” is not on the horizon -- it’s already here.
While computers offer these conveniences to consumers, they have many advantages for sellers too. Electronic cash registers can do much more than simply ring up sales. They can keep a wide range of records, including who sold what, when, and to whom. This information allows businessmen to keep track of their list of goods by showing which items are being sold and how fast they are moving. Decisions to reorder or return goods to suppliers can then be made. At the same time these computers record which hours are busiest and which employees are the most efficient, allowing personnel and staffing assignments to be made accordingly. And they also identify preferred customers for promotional campaigns. Computers are relied on by manufacturers for similar reasons. Computer-analyzed marketing reports can help to decide which products to emphasize now, which to develop for the future, and which to drop. Computers keep track of goods in stock, of raw materials on hand, and even of the production process itself.
Numerous other commercial enterprises, from theaters to magazine publishers, from gas and electric utilities to milk processors, bring better and more efficient services to consumers through the use of computers.
55.	According to the passage, the credit card enables its owner to ________.
[A] withdraw as much money from the bank as he wishes
[B] obtain more convenient services than other people do
[C] enjoy greater trust from the storekeeper
[D] cash money wherever he wishes to
56.	From the last sentence of the first paragraph we learn that ________.
[A] in the future all the Americans will use credit cards
[B] credit cards are mainly used in the United States today
[C] nowadays many Americans do not pay in cash
[D] it is now more convenient to use credit cards than before
57.	The phrase “ring up sales” (Line 3, Para. 2) most probably means “________”.
[A] make an order of goods
[B] record sales on a cash register
[C] call the sales manager
[D] keep track of the goods in stock
58.	What is this passage mainly about?
[A] Approaches to the commercial use of computers.
[B] Conveniences brought about by computers in business.
[C] Significance of automation in commercial enterprises.
[D] Advantages of credit cards in business.
Text 3
Exceptional children are different in some significant way from others of the same age. For these children to develop to their full adult potential, their education must be adapted to those differences.
Although we focus on the needs of exceptional children, we find ourselves describing their environment as well. While the leading actor on the stage captures our attention, we are aware of the importance of the supporting players and the scenery of the play itself. Both the family and the society in which exceptional children live are often the key to their growth and development. And it is in the public schools that we find the full expression of society’s understanding -- the knowledge, hopes, and fears that are passed on to the next generation.
Education in any society is a mirror of that society. In that mirror we can see the strengths, the weaknesses, the hopes, the prejudices, and the central values of the culture itself. The great interest in exceptional children shown in public education over the past three decades indicates the strong feeling in our society that all citizens, whatever their special conditions, deserve the opportunity to fully develop their capabilities.
“All men are created equal.” We’ve heard it many times, but it still has important meaning for education in a democratic society. Although the phrase was used by this country’s founders to denote equality before the law, it has also been interpreted to mean equality of opportunity. That concept implies educational opportunity for all children -- the right of each child to receive help in learning to the limits of his or her capacity, whether that capacity be small or great. Recent court decisions have confirmed the right of all children -- disabled or not -- to an appropriate education, and have ordered that public schools take the necessary steps to provide that education. In response, schools are modifying their programs, adapting instruction to children who are exceptional, to those who cannot profit substantially from regular programs.
59.	In Paragraph 2, the author cites the example of the leading actor on the stage to show that
[A] the growth of exceptional children has much to do with their family and the society
[B] exceptional children are more influenced by their families than normal children are
[C] exceptional children are the key interest of the family and society
[D] the needs of the society weigh much heavier than the needs of the exceptional children
60.	The reason that the exceptional children receive so much concern in education is that ________.
[A] they are expected to be leaders of the society
[B] they might become a burden of the society
[C] they should fully develop their potentials
[D] disabled children deserve special consideration
61.	This passage mainly deals with ________.
[A] the differences of children in their learning capabilities
[B] the definition of exceptional children in modern society
[C] the special educational programs for exceptional children
[D] the necessity of adapting education to exceptional children
62.	From this passage we learn that the educational concern for exceptional children ________.
[A] is now enjoying legal support
[B] disagrees with the tradition of the country
[C] was clearly stated by the country’s founders
[D] will exert great influence over court decisions

“I have great confidence that by the end of the decade we’ll know in vast detail how cancer cells arise,” says microbiologist Robert Weinberg, an expert on cancer. “But,” he cautions, “some people have the idea that once one understands the causes, the cure will rapidly follow. Consider Pasteur, he discovered the causes of many kinds of infections, but it was fifty or sixty years before cures were available.”
This year, 50 percent of the 910,000 people who suffer from cancer will survive at least five years. In the year 2000, the National Cancer Institute estimates, that figure will be 75 percent. For some skin cancers, the five-year survival rate is as high as 90 percent. But other survival statistics are still discouraging -- 13 percent for lung cancer, and 2 percent for cancer of the pancreas.
With as many as 120 varieties in existence, discovering how cancer works is not easy. The researchers made great progress in the early 1970s, when they discovered that oncogenes, which are cancer-causing genes, are inactive in normal cells. Anything from cosmic rays to radiation to diet may activate a dormant oncogene, but how remains unknown. If several oncogenes are driven into action, the cell, unable to turn them off, becomes cancerous.
The exact mechanisms involved are still mysterious, but the likelihood that many cancers are initiated at the level of genes suggests that we will never prevent all cancers. “Changes are a normal part of the evolutionary process,” says oncologist William Hayward. Environmental factors can never be totally eliminated; as Hayward points out, “We can’t prepare a medicine against cosmic rays.”
The prospects for cure, though still distant, are brighter.
“First, we need to understand how the normal cell controls itself. Second, we have to determine whether there are a limited number of genes in cells which are always responsible for at least part of the trouble. If we can understand how cancer works, we can counteract its action.”
63.	The example of Pasteur in the passage is used to ________.
[A] predict that the secret of cancer will be disclosed in a decade
[B] indicate that the prospects for curing cancer are bright
[C] prove that cancer will be cured in fifty to sixty years
[D] warn that there is still a long way to go before cancer can be conquered
64.	The author implies that by the year 2000, ________.
[A] there will be a drastic rise in the five-year survival rate of skin-cancer patients
[B] 90 percent of the skin-cancer patients today will still be living
[C] the survival statistics will be fairly even among patients with various cancers
[D] there won’ t be a drastic increase of survival rate of all cancer patients
65.	Oncogenes are cancer-causing genes ________.
[A] that are always in operation in a healthy person
[B] which remain unharmful so long as they are not activated
[C] that can be driven out of normal cells
[D] which normal cells can’t turn off
66.	The word “dormant” in the third paragraph most probably means ________.
[A] dead
[B] ever-present
[C] inactive
[D] potential

Discoveries in science and technology are thought by “untaught minds” to come in blinding flashes or as the result of dramatic accidents. Sir Alexander Fleming did not, as legend would have it, look at the mold on a piece of cheese and get the idea for penicillin there and then. He experimented with antibacterial substances for nine years before he made his discovery. Inventions and innovations almost always come out of laborious trial and error. Innovation is like soccer; even the best players miss the goal and have their shots blocked much more frequently than they score.
The point is that the players who score most are the ones who take most shots at the goal -- and so it goes with innovation in any field of activity. The prime difference between innovation and others is one of approach. Everybody gets ideas, but innovators work consciously on theirs, and they follow them through until they prove practicable or otherwise. What ordinary people see as fanciful abstractions, professional innovators see as solid possibilities.
“Creative thinking may mean simply the realization that there’s no particular virtue in doing things the way they have always been done,” wrote Rudolph Flesch, a language authority. This accounts for our reaction to seemingly simple innovations like plastic garbage bags and suitcases on wheels that make life more convenient: “How come nobody thought of that before?”
The creative approach begins with the proposition that nothing is as it appears. Innovators will not accept that there is only one way to do anything. Faced with getting from A to B, the average person will automatically set out on the best-known and apparently simplest route. The innovator will search for alternate courses, which may prove easier in the long run and are bound to be more interesting and challenging even if they lead to dead ends.
Highly creative individuals really do march to a different drummer.
67.	What does the author probably mean by “untaught mind” in the first paragraph?
[A] A person ignorant of the hard work involved in experimentation.
[B] A citizen of a society that restricts personal creativity.
[C] A person who has had no education.
[D] An individual who often comes up with new ideas by accident.
68.	According to the author, what distinguishes innovators from non-innovators?
[A] The variety of ideas they have.
[B] The intelligence they possess.
[C] The way they deal with problems.
[D] The way they present their findings.
69.	The author quotes Rudolph Flesch in Paragraph 3 because ________.
[A] Rudolph Flesch is the best-known expert in the study of human creativity
[B] the quotation strengthens the assertion that creative individuals look for new ways of doing things
[C] the reader is familiar with Rudolph Flesch’s point of view
[D] the quotation adds a new idea to the information previously presented
70.	The phrase “march to a different drummer” (the last line of the passage) suggests that highly creative individuals are ________.
[A] diligent in pursuing their goals
[B] reluctant to follow common ways of doing things
[C] devoted to the progress of science
[D] concerned about the advance of society

Directions:
Read the following passage carefully and then translate underlined sentences into Chinese. Your translation must be written neatly on ANSWER SHEET 2. (15 points)
According to the new school of scientists, technology is an overlooked force in expanding the horizons of scientific knowledge. (71) Science moves forward, they say, not so much through the insights of great men of genius as because of more ordinary things like improved techniques and tools. (72) “In short,” a leader of the new school contends, “the scientific revolution, as we call it, was largely the improvement and invention and use of a series of instruments that expanded the reach of science in innumerable directions.” (73) Over the years, tools and technology themselves as a source of fundamental innovation have largely been ignored by historians and philosophers of science. The modern school that hails technology argues that such masters as Galileo, Newton, Maxwell, Einstein, and inventors such as Edison attached great importance to, and derived great benefit from, craft information and technological devices of different kinds that were usable in scientific experiments.
The centerpiece of the argument of a technology-yes, genius-no advocate was an analysis of Galileo’s role at the start of the scientific revolution. The wisdom of the day was derived from Ptolemy, an astronomer of the second century, whose elaborate system of the sky put Earth at the center of all heavenly motions. (74) Galileo’s greatest glory was that in 1609 he was the first person to turn the newly invented telescope on the heavens to prove that the planets revolve around the sun rather than around the Earth. But the real hero of the story, according to the new school of scientists, was the long evolution in the improvement of machinery for making eyeglasses.
Federal policy is necessarily involved in the technology vs. genius dispute. (75) Whether the Government should increase the financing of pure science at the expense of technology or vice versa often depends on the issue of which is seen as the driving force.

Money spent on advertising is money spent as well as any I know of. It serves directly to assist a rapid distribution of goods at reasonable prices, thereby establishing a firm home market and so making it possible to provide for export at competitive prices. By drawing attention to new ideas it helps enormously to raise standards of living. By helping to increase demand it ensures an increased need for labour, and is therefore an effective way to fight unemployment. It lowers the costs of many services: without advertisements your daily newspaper would cost four times as much, the price of your television license would need to be doubled and travel by bus or tube would cost 20 per cent more.
And perhaps most important of all, advertising provides a guarantee of reasonable value in the products and services you buy. Apart from the fact that twenty-seven Acts of Parliament govern the terms of advertising, no regular advertiser dare promote a product that fails to live up to the promise of his advertisements. He might fool some people for a little while through misleading advertising. He will not do so for long, for mercifully the public has the good sense not to buy the inferior article more than once. If you see an article consistently advertised, it is the surest proof I know that the article does what is claimed for it, and that it represents good value.
Advertising does more for the material benefit of the community than any other force I can think of.
There is one point I feel I ought to touch on. Recently I heard a well-known television personality declare that he was against advertising because it persuades rather than informs. He was drawing excessively fine distinctions. Of course advertising seeks to persuade.
If its message were confined merely to information -- and that in itself would be difficult if not impossible to achieve, for even a detail such as the choice of the colour of a shirt is subtly persuasive -- advertising would be so boring that no one would pay any attention. But perhaps that is what the well-known television personality wants.
51.	By the first sentence of the passage the author means that ________.
[A] he is fairly familiar with the cost of advertising
[B] everybody knows well that advertising is money consuming
[C] advertising costs money like everything else
[D] it is worthwhile to spend money on advertising
52.	In the passage, which of the following is NOT included in the advantages of advertising?
[A] Securing greater fame.
[B] Providing more jobs.
[C] Enhancing living standards.
[D] Reducing newspaper cost.
53.	The author deems that the well-known TV personality is ________.
[A] very precise in passing his judgment on advertising
[B] interested in nothing but the buyers’ attention
[C] correct in telling the difference between persuasion and information
[D] obviously partial in his views on advertising
54.	In the author’s opinion, ________.
[A] advertising can seldom bring material benefit to man by providing information
[B] advertising informs people of new ideas rather than wins them over
[C] there is nothing wrong with advertising in persuading the buyer
[D] the buyer is not interested in getting information from an advertisement

There are two basic ways to see growth: one as a product, the other as a process. People have generally viewed personal growth as an external result or product that can easily be identified and measured. The worker who gets a promotion, the student whose grades improve, the foreigner who learns a new language -- all these are examples of people who have measurable results to show for their efforts.
By contrast, the process of personal growth is much more difficult to determine, since by definition it is a journey and not the specific signposts or landmarks along the way. The process is not the road itself, but rather the attitudes and feelings people have, their caution or courage, as they encounter new experiences and unexpected obstacles. In this process, the journey never really ends; there are always new ways to experience the world, new ideas to try, new challenges to accept.
In order to grow, to travel new roads, people need to have a willingness to take risks, to confront the unknown, and to accept the possibility that they may “fail” at first. How we see ourselves as we try a new way of being is essential to our ability to grow. Do we perceive ourselves as quick and curious? If so, then we tend to take more chances and to be more open to unfamiliar experiences. Do we think we’re shy and indecisive? Then our sense of timidity can cause us to hesitate, to move slowly, and not to take a step until we know the ground is safe. Do we think we’re slow to adapt to change or that we’re not smart enough to cope with a new challenge? Then we are likely to take a more passive role or not try at all.
These feelings of insecurity and self-doubt are both unavoidable and necessary if we are to change and grow. If we do not confront and overcome these internal fears and doubts, if we protect ourselves too much, then we cease to grow. We become trapped inside a shell of our own making.
55.	A person is generally believed to achieve personal growth when ________.
[A] he has given up his smoking habit
[B] he has made great efforts in his work
[C] he is keen on leaning anything new
[D] he has tried to determine where he is on his journey
56.	In the author’s eyes, one who views personal growth as a process would ________.
[A] succeed in climbing up the social ladder
[B] judge his ability to grow from his own achievements
[C] face difficulties and take up challenges
[D] aim high and reach his goal each time
57.	When the author says “a new way of being” (Line 2~3, Para. 3) he is referring to ________.
[A] a new approach to experiencing the world
[B] a new way of taking risks
[C] a new method of perceiving ourselves
[D] a new system of adaptation to change
58.	For personal growth, the author advocates all of the following EXCEPT ________.
[A] curiosity about more chances
[B] promptness in self-adaptation
[C] open-mindedness to new experiences
[D] avoidance of internal fears and doubts

In such a changing, complex society formerly simple solutions to informational needs become complicated. Many of life’s problems which were solved by asking family members, friends or colleagues are beyond the capability of the extended family to resolve. Where to turn for expert information and how to determine which expert advice to accept are questions facing many people today.
In addition to this, there is the growing mobility of people since World War II. As families move away from their stable community, their friends of many years, their extended family relationships, the informal flow of information is cut off, and with it the confidence that information will be available when needed and will be trustworthy and reliable. The almost unconscious flow of information about the simplest aspects of living can be cut off. Thus, things once learned subconsciously through the casual communications of the extended family must be consciously learned.
Adding to societal changes today is an enormous stockpile of information. The individual now has more information available than any generation, and the task of finding that one piece of information relevant to his or her specific problem is complicated, time-consuming and sometimes even overwhelming.
Coupled with the growing quantity of information is the development of technologies which enable the storage and delivery of more information with greater speed to more locations than has ever been possible before. Computer technology makes it possible to store vast amounts of data in machine-readable files, and to program computers to locate specific information. Telecommunications developments enable the sending of messages via television, radio, and very shortly, electronic mail to bombard people with multitudes of messages. Satellites have extended the power of communications to report events at the instant of occurrence. Expertise can be shared worldwide through teleconferencing, and problems in dispute can be settled without the participants leaving their homes and/or jobs to travel to a distant conference site. Technology has facilitated the sharing of information and the storage and delivery of information, thus making more information available to more people.
In this world of change and complexity, the need for information is of greatest importance. Those people who have accurate, reliable up-to-date information to solve the day-to-day problems, the critical problems of their business, social and family life, will survive and succeed. “Knowledge is power” may well be the truest saying and access to information may be the most critical requirement of all people.
59.	The word “it” (Line 3, Para. 2) most probably refers to ________.
[A] the lack of stable communities
[B] the breakdown of informal information channels
[C] the increased mobility of families
[D] the growing number of people moving from place to place
60.	The main problem people may encounter today arises from the fact that ________.
[A] they have to learn new things consciously
[B] they lack the confidence of securing reliable and trustworthy information
[C] they have difficulty obtaining the needed information readily
[D] they can hardly carry out casual communications with an extended family
61.	From the passage we can infer that ________.
[A] electronic mail will soon play a dominant role in transmitting messages
[B] it will become more difficult for people to keep secrets in an information era
[C] people will spend less time holding meetings or conferences
[D] events will be reported on the spot mainly through satellites
62.	We can learn from the last paragraph that ________.
[A] it is necessary to obtain as much knowledge as possible
[B] people should make the best use of the information accessible
[C] we should realize the importance of accumulating information
[D] it is of vital importance to acquire needed information efficiently
Text 4
Personality is to a large extent inherent -- A-type parents usually bring about A-type offspring. But the environment must also have a profound effect, since if competition is important to the parents, it is likely to become a major factor in the lives of their children.
One place where children soak up A-characteristics is school, which is, by its very nature, a highly competitive institution. Too many schools adopt the “win at all costs” moral standard and measure their success by sporting achievements. The current passion for making children compete against their classmates or against the clock produces a two-layer system, in which competitive A-types seem in some way better than their B-type fellows. Being too keen to win can have dangerous consequences: remember that Pheidippides, the first marathon runner, dropped dead seconds after saying: “Rejoice, we conquer!”
By far the worst form of competition in schools is the disproportionate emphasis on examinations. It is a rare school that allows pupils to concentrate on those things they do well. The merits of competition by examination are somewhat questionable, but competition in the certain knowledge of failure is positively harmful.
Obviously, it is neither practical nor desirable that all A youngsters change into B’s. The world needs A types, and schools have an important duty to try to fit a child’s personality to his possible future employment. It is top management.
If the preoccupation of schools with academic work was lessened, more time might be spent teaching children surer values. Perhaps selection for the caring professions, especially medicine, could be made less by good grades in chemistry and more by such considerations as sensitivity and sympathy. It is surely a mistake to choose our doctors exclusively from A-type stock. B’s are important and should be encouraged.
63.	According to the passage, A-type individuals are usually ________.
[A] impatient
[B] considerate
[C] aggressive
[D] agreeable
64.	The author is strongly opposed to the practice of examinations at schools because ________.
[A] the pressure is too great on the students
[B] some students are bound to fail
[C] failure rates are too high
[D] the results of exanimations are doubtful
65.	The selection of medical professionals is currently based on ________.
[A] candidates’ sensitivity
[B] academic achievements
[C] competitive spirit
[D] surer values
66.	From the passage we can draw the conclusion that ________.
[A] the personality of a child is well established at birth
[B] family influence dominates the shaping of one’s characteristics
[C] the development of one’s personality is due to multiple factors
[D] B-type characteristics can find no place in competitive society
Text 5
That experiences influence subsequent behaviour is evidence of an obvious but nevertheless remarkable activity called remembering. Learning could not occur without the function popularly named memory. Constant practice has such an effect on memory as to lead to skillful performance on the piano, to recitation of a poem, and even to reading and understanding these words. So-called intelligent behaviour demands memory, remembering being a primary requirement for reasoning. The ability to solve any problem or even to recognize that a problem exists depends on memory. Typically, the decision to cross a street is based on remembering many earlier experiences.
Practice (or review) tends to build and maintain memory for a task or for any learned material. Over a period of no practice what has been learned tends to be forgotten; and the adaptive consequences may not seem obvious. Yet, dramatic instances of sudden forgetting can be seen to be adaptive. In this sense, the ability to forget can be interpreted to have survived through a process of natural selection in animals. Indeed, when one’s memory of an emotionally painful experience lead to serious anxiety, forgetting may produce relief. Nevertheless, an evolutionary interpretation might make it difficult to understand how the commonly gradual process of forgetting survived natural selection.
In thinking about the evolution of memory together with all its possible aspects, it is helpful to consider what would happen if memories failed to fade. Forgetting clearly aids orientation in time, since old memories weaken and the new tend to stand out, providing clues for inferring duration. Without forgetting, adaptive ability would suffer, for example, learned behaviour that might have been correct a decade ago may no longer be. Cases are recorded of people who (by ordinary standards) forgot so little that their everyday activities were full of confusion. Thus forgetting seems to serve that survival of the individual and the species.
Another line of thought assumes a memory storage system of limited capacity that provides adaptive flexibility specifically through forgetting. In this view, continual adjustments are made between learning or memory storage (input) and forgetting (output). Indeed, there is evidence that the rate at which individuals forget is directly related to how much they have learned. Such data offer gross support of contemporary models of memory that assume an input-output balance.
67.	From the evolutionary point of view, ________.
[A] forgetting for lack of practice tends to be obviously inadaptive
[B] if a person gets very forgetful all of a sudden he must be very adaptive
[C] the gradual process of forgetting is an indication of an individual’s adaptability
[D] sudden forgetting may bring about adaptive consequences
68.	According to the passage, if a person never forgot, ________.
[A] he would survive best
[B] he would have a lot of trouble
[C] his ability to learn would be enhanced
[D] the evolution of memory would stop
69.	From the last paragraph we know that ________.
[A] forgetfulness is a response to learning
[B] the memory storage system is an exactly balanced input-output system
[C] memory is a compensation for forgetting
[D] the capacity of a memory storage system is limited because forgetting occurs
70.	In this article, the author tries to interpret the function of ________.
[A] remembering
[B] forgetting
[C] adapting
[D] experiencing

The standardized educational or psychological tests that are widely used to aid in selecting, classifying, assigning, or promoting students, employees, and military personnel have been the target of recent attacks in books, magazines, the daily press, and even in Congress. 71) The target is wrong, for in attacking the tests, critics divert attention from the fault that lies with ill-informed or incompetent users. The tests themselves are merely tools, with characteristics that can be measured with reasonable precision under specified conditions. Whether the results will be valuable, meaningless, or even misleading depends partly upon the tool itself but largely upon the user.
All informed predictions of future performance are based upon some knowledge of relevant past performance: school grades, research productivity, sales records, or whatever is appropriate. 72) How well the predictions will be validated by later performance depends upon the amount, reliability, and appropriateness of the information used and on the skill and wisdom with which it is interpreted. Anyone who keeps careful score knows that the information available is always incomplete and that the predictions are always subject to error.
Standardized tests should be considered in this context. They provide a quick, objective method of getting some kinds of information about what a person learned, the skills he has developed, or the kind of person he is. The information so obtained has, qualitatively, the same advantages and shortcomings as other kinds of information. 73) Whether to use tests, other kinds of information, or both in a particular situation depends, therefore, upon the evidence from experience concerning comparative validity and upon such factors as cost and availability.
74) In general, the tests work most effectively when the qualities to be measured can be most precisely defined and least effectively when what is to be measured or predicted cannot be well defined. Properly used, they provide a rapid means of getting comparable information about many people. Sometimes they identify students whose high potential has not been previously recognized, but there are many things they do not do. 75) For example, they do not compensate for gross social inequality, and thus do not tell how able an underprivileged youngster might have been had he grown up under more favorable circumstances.

Tight-lipped elders used to say, “It’s not what you want in this world, but what you get.”
Psychology teaches that you do get what you want if you know what you want and want the right things.
You can make a mental blueprint of a desire as you would make a blueprint of a house, and each of us is continually making these blueprints in the general routine of everyday living. If we intend to have friends to dinner, we plan the menu, make a shopping list, decide which food to cook first, and such planning is an essential for any type of meal to be served.
Likewise, if you want to find a job, take a sheet of paper, and write a brief account of yourself. In making a blueprint for a job, begin with yourself, for when you know exactly what you have to offer, you can intelligently plan where to sell your services.
This account of yourself is actually a sketch of your working life and should include education, experience and references. Such an account is valuable. It can be referred to in filling out standard application blanks and is extremely helpful in personal interviews. While talking to you, your could-be employer is deciding whether your education, your experience, and other qualifications, will pay him to employ you and your “wares” and abilities must be displayed in an orderly and reasonably connected manner.
When you have carefully prepared a blueprint of your abilities and desires, you have something tangible to sell. Then you are ready to hunt for a job. Get all the possible information about your could-be job. Make inquiries as to the details regarding the job and the firm. Keep your eyes and ears open, and use your own judgment. Spend a certain amount of time each day seeking the employment you wish for, and keep in mind: Securing a job is your job now.
51.	What do the elders mean when they say, “It’s not what you want in this world, but what you get.”?
[A] You’ll certainly get what you want.
[B] It’s no use dreaming.
[C] You should be dissatisfied with what you have.
[D] It’s essential to set a goal for yourself.
52.	A blueprint made before inviting a friend to dinner is used in this passage as ________.
[A] an illustration of how to write an application for a job
[B] an indication of how to secure a good job
[C] a guideline for job description
[D] a principle for job evaluation
53.	According to the passage, one must write an account of himself before starting to find a job because ________.
[A] that is the first step to please the employer
[B] that is the requirement of the employer
[C] it enables him to know when to sell his services
[D] it forces him to become clearly aware of himself
54.	When you have carefully prepared a blueprint of your abilities and desires, you have something ________.
[A] definite to offer
[B] imaginary to provide
[C] practical to supply
[D] desirable to present

With the start of BBC World Service Television, millions of viewers in Asia and America can now watch the Corporation’s news coverage, as well as listen to it.
And of course in Britain listeners and viewers can tune in to two BBC television channels, five BBC national radio services and dozens of local radio stations. They are brought sport, comedy, drama, music, news and current affairs, education, religion, parliamentary coverage, children’s programmes and films for an annual license fee of ￡83 per household.
It is a remarkable record, stretching back over 70 years -- yet the BBC’s future is now in doubt. The Corporation will survive as a publicly-funded broadcasting organization, at least for the time being, but its role, its size and its programmes are now the subject of a nation-wide debate in Britain.
The debate was launched by the Government, which invited anyone with an opinion of the BBC -- including ordinary listeners and viewers -- to say what was good or bad about the Corporation, and even whether they thought it was worth keeping. The reason for its inquiry is that the BBC’s royal charter runs out in 1996 and it must decide whether to keep the organization as it is, or to make changes.
Defenders of the Corporation -- of whom there are many -- are fond of quoting the American slogan “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” The BBC “ain’t broke,” they say, by which they mean it is not broken (as distinct from the word ‘broke’, meaning having no money), so why bother to change it?
Yet the BBC will have to change, because the broadcasting world around it is changing. The commercial TV channels C ITV and Channel 4 -- were required by the Thatcher Government’s Broadcasting Act to become more commercial, competing with each other for advertisers, and cutting costs and jobs. But it is the arrival of new satellite channels -- funded partly by advertising and partly by viewers’ subscriptions -- which will bring about the biggest changes in the long term.
55.	The world famous BBC now faces ________.
[A] the problem of new coverage
[B] an uncertain prospect
[C] inquiries by the general public
[D] shrinkage of audience
56.	In the passage, which of the following about the BBC is NOT mentioned as the key issue?
[A] Extension of its TV service to Far East.
[B] Programmes as the subject of a nation-wide debate.
[C] Potentials for further international cooperations.
[D] Its existence as a broadcasting organization.
57.	The BBC’s “royal charter” (Line 4, Paragraph 4) stands for ________.
[A] the financial support from the royal family
[B] the privileges granted by the Queen
[C] a contract with the Queen
[D] a unique relationship with the royal family
58.	The foremost reason why the BBC has to readjust itself is no other than ________.
[A] the emergence of commercial TV channels
[B] the enforcement of Broadcasting Act by the government
[C] the urgent necessity to reduce costs and jobs
[D] the challenge of new satellite channels

In the last half of the nineteenth century “capital” and “labour” were enlarging and perfecting their rival organizations on modern lines. Many an old firm was replaced by a limited liability company with a bureaucracy of salaried managers. The change met the technical requirements of the new age by engaging a large professional element and prevented the decline in efficiency that so commonly spoiled the fortunes of family firms in the second and third generation after the energetic founders. It was moreover a step away from individual initiative, towards collectivism and municipal and state-owned business. The railway companies, though still private business managed for the benefit of shareholders, were very unlike old family business. At the same time the great municipalities went into business to supply lighting, trams and other services to the taxpayers.
The growth of the limited liability company and municipal business had important consequences. Such large, impersonal manipulation of capital and industry greatly increased the numbers and importance of shareholders as a class, an element in national life representing irresponsible wealth detached from the land and the duties of the landowners; and almost equally detached from the responsible management of business. All through the nineteenth century, America, Africa, India, Australia and parts of Europe were being developed by British capital, and British shareholders were thus enriched by the world’s movement towards industrialization. Towns like Bournemouth and Eastbourne sprang up to house large “comfortable” classes who had retired on their incomes, and who had no relation to the rest of the community except that of drawing dividends and occasionally attending a shareholders’ meeting to dictate their orders to the management. On the other hand “shareholding” meant leisure and freedom which was used by many of the later Victorians for the highest purpose of a great civilization.
The “shareholders” as such had no knowledge of the lives, thoughts or needs of the workmen employed by the company in which he held shares, and his influence on the relations of capital and labour was not good. The paid manager acting for the company was in more direct relation with the men and their demands, but even he had seldom that familiar personal knowledge of the workmen which the employer had often had under the more patriarchal system of the old family business now passing away. Indeed the mere size of operations and the numbers of workmen involved rendered such personal relations impossible. Fortunately, however, the increasing power and organization of the trade unions, at least in all skilled trades, enabled the workmen to meet on equal terms the managers of the companies who employed them. The cruel discipline of the strike and lockout taught the two parties to respect each other’s strength and understand the value of fair negotiation.
59.	It’s true of the old family firms that ________.
[A] they were spoiled by the younger generations
[B] they failed for lack of individual initiative
[C] they lacked efficiency compared with modern companies
[D] they could supply adequate services to the taxpayers
60.	The growth of limited liability companies resulted in ________.
[A] the separation of capital from management
[B] the ownership of capital by managers
[C] the emergence of capital and labour as two classes
[D] the participation of shareholders in municipal business
61.	According to the passage, all of the following are true EXCEPT that ________.
[A] the shareholders were unaware of the needs of the workers
[B] the old firm owners had a better understanding of their workers
[C] the limited liability companies were too large to run smoothly
[D] the trade unions seemed to play a positive role
62.	The author is most critical of ________.
[A] family film owners
[B] landowners
[C] managers
[D] shareholders

What accounts for the great outburst of major inventions in early America -- breakthroughs such as the telegraph, the steamboat and the weaving machine?
Among the many shaping factors, I would single out the country’s excellent elementary schools: a labor force that welcomed the new technology; the practice of giving premiums to inventors; and above all the American genius for nonverbal, “spatial” thinking about things technological.
Why mention the elementary schools? Because thanks to these schools our early mechanics, especially in the New England and Middle Atlantic states, were generally literate and at home in arithmetic and in some aspects of geometry and trigonometry.
Acute foreign observers related American adaptiveness and inventiveness to this educational advantage. As a member of a British commission visiting here in 1853 reported, “With a mind prepared by thorough school discipline, the American boy develops rapidly into the skilled workman.”
A further stimulus to invention came from the “premium” system, which preceded our patent system and for years ran parallel with it. This approach, originated abroad, offered inventors medals, cash prizes and other incentives.
In the United States, multitudes of premiums for new devices were awarded at country fairs and at the industrial fairs in major cities. Americans flocked to these fairs to admire the new machines and thus to renew their faith in the beneficence of technological advance.
Given this optimistic approach to technological innovation, the American worker took readily to that special kind of nonverbal thinking required in mechanical technology. As Eugene Ferguson has pointed out, “A technologist thinks about objects that cannot be reduced to unambiguous verbal descriptions: they are dealt with in his mind by a visual, nonverbal process... The designer and the inventor... are able to assemble and manipulate in their minds devices that as yet do not exist.”
This nonverbal “spatial” thinking can be just as creative as painting and writing. Robert Fulton once wrote, “The mechanic should sit down among levers, screws, wedges, wheels, etc., like a poet among the letters of the alphabet, considering them as an exhibition of his thoughts, in which a new arrangement transmits a new idea.”
When all these shaping forces -- schools, open attitudes, the premium system, a genius for spatial thinking -- interacted with one another on the rich U.S. mainland, they produced that American characteristic, emulation. Today that word implies mere imitation. But in earlier times it meant a friendly but competitive striving for fame and excellence.
63.	According to the author, the great outburst of major inventions in early America was in a large part due to ________.
[A] elementary schools
[B] enthusiastic workers
[C] the attractive premium system
[D] a special way of thinking
64.	It is implied that adaptiveness and inventiveness of the early American mechanics ________.
[A] benefited a lot from their mathematical knowledge
[B] shed light on disciplined school management
[C] was brought about by privileged home training
[D] owed a lot to the technological development
65.	A technologist can be compared to an artist because ________.
[A] they are both winners of awards
[B] they are both experts in spatial thinking
[C] they both abandon verbal description
[D] they both use various instruments
66.	The best title for this passage might be ________.
[A] Inventive Mind
[B] Effective Schooling
[B] Ways of Thinking
[D] Outpouring of Inventions

Rumor has it that more than 20 books on creationism/evolution are in the publisher’s pipelines. A few have already appeared. The goal of all will be to try to explain to a confused and often unenlightened citizenry that there are not two equally valid scientific theories for the origin and evolution of universe and life. Cosmology, geology, and biology have provided a consistent, unified, and constantly improving account of what happened. “Scientific” creationism, which is being pushed by some for “equal time” in the classrooms whenever the scientific accounts of evolution are given, is based on religion, not science. Virtually all scientists and the majority of non-fundamentalist religious leaders have come to regard “scientific” creationism as bad science and bad religion.
The first four chapters of Kitcher’s book give a very brief introduction to evolution. At appropriate places, he introduces the criticisms of the creationists and provides answers. In the last three chapters, he takes off his gloves and gives the creationists a good beating. He describes their programmes and tactics, and, for those unfamiliar with the ways of creationists, the extent of their deception and distortion may come as an unpleasant surprise. When their basic motivation is religious, one might have expected more Christian behavior.
Kitcher is a philosopher, and this may account, in part, for the clarity and effectiveness of his arguments. The non-specialist will be able to obtain at least a notion of the sorts of data and argument that support evolutionary theory. The final chapter on the creationists will be extremely clear to all. On the dust jacket of this fine book, Stephen Jay Gould says: “This book stands for reason itself.” And so it does -- and all would be well were reason the only judge in the creationism/evolution debate.
67.	“Creationism” in the passage refers to ________.
[A] evolution in its true sense as to the origin of the universe
[B] a notion of the creation of religion
[C] the scientific explanation of the earth formation
[D] the deceptive theory about the origin of the universe
68.	Kitcher’s book is intended to ________.
[A] recommend the views of the evolutionists
[B] expose the true features of creationists
[C] curse bitterly at this opponents
[D] launch a surprise attack on creationists
69.	From the passage we can infer that ________.
[A] reasoning has played a decisive role in the debate
[B] creationists do not base their argument on reasoning
[C] evolutionary theory is too difficult for non-specialists
[D] creationism is supported by scientific findings
70.	This passage appears to be a digest of ________.
[A] a book review
[B] a scientific paper
[C] a magazine feature
[D] a newspaper editorial

The differences in relative growth of various areas of scientific research have several causes. 71) Some of these causes are completely reasonable results of social needs. Others are reasonable consequences of particular advances in science being to some extent self-accelerating. Some, however, are less reasonable processes of different growth in which preconception of the form scientific theory ought to take, by persons in authority, act to alter the growth pattern of different areas. This is a new problem probably not yet unavoidable; but it is a frightening trend. 72) This trend began during the Second World War, when several governments came to the conclusion that the specific demands that a government wants to make of its scientific establishment cannot generally be foreseen in detail. It can be predicted, however, that from time to time, questions will arise which will require specific scientific answers. It is therefore generally valuable to treat the scientific establishment as a resource or machine to be kept in functional order. 73) This seems mostly effectively done by supporting a certain amount of research not related to immediate goals but of possible consequence in the future.
This kind of support, like all government support, requires decisions about the appropriate recipients of funds. Decisions based on utility as opposed to lack of utility are straightforward. But a decision among projects none of which has immediate utility is more difficult. The goal of the supporting agencies is the praisable one of supporting “good” as opposed to “bad” science, but a valid determination is difficult to make. Generally, the idea of good science tends to become confused with the capacity of the field in question to generate an elegant theory. 74) However, the world is so made that elegant systems are in principle unable to deal with some of the world’s more fascinating and delightful aspects. 75) New forms of thought as well as new subjects for thought must arise in the future as they have in the past, giving rise to new standards of elegance.

GOOD HEALTH
Wherever you are and whatever you do, staying healthy is always important. With the improvement of our living standards, people are attaching more and more importance to their health. We students can’t keep the high study efficiency without good health. The same thing is true with workers, scientists and doctors.
In my opinion, good diet and exercises are two major ways to keep healthy. The food we eat every day must be rational and should include meat, vegetables, eggs, and fruit. It is important to drink water every day and not to get addicted to drinking coffee or some other soft drinks. Exercising every day is also essential for us to stay healthy. We can ride bicycles, play tennis or swim. Of course we don’t need to exhaust ourselves. We should plan our physical exercises according to our actual condition. An hour a day is enough.
As a university student, I have much free time to do exercises. I usually play badminton and tennis. But sometimes I am lazy and do not exercise for all kinds of excuses, such as cold weather and exams. I must correct it. I am also careful with my diet. In a way, keeping healthy is not very hard, if you just take it seriously.

Text 1
It was 3:45 in the morning when the vote was finally taken. After six months of arguing and final 16 hours of hot parliamentary debates, Australia’s Northern Territory became the first legal authority in the world to allow doctors to take the lives of incurably ill patients who wish to die. The measure passed by the convincing vote of 15 to 10. Almost immediately word flashed on the Internet and was picked up, half a world away, by John Hofsess, executive director of the Right to Die Society of Canada. He sent it on via the group’s on-line service, Death NET. Says Hofsess: “We posted bulletins all day long, because of course this isn’t just something that happened in Australia. It’s world history.”
The full import may take a while to sink in. The NT Rights of the Terminally Ill law has left physicians and citizens alike trying to deal with its moral and practical implications. Some have breathed sighs of relief, others, including churches, right-to-life groups and the Australian Medical Association, bitterly attacked the bill and the haste of its passage. But the tide is unlikely to turn back. In Australia -- where an aging population, life-extending technology and changing community attitudes have all played their part -- other states are going to consider making a similar law to deal with euthanasia. In the US and Canada, where the right-to-die movement is gathering strength, observers are waiting for the dominoes to start falling.
Under the new Northern Territory law, an adult patient can request death -- probably by a deadly injection or pill -- to put an end to suffering. The patient must be diagnosed as terminally ill by two doctors. After a “cooling off” period of seven days, the patient can sign a certificate of request. After 48 hours the wish for death can be met. For Lloyd Nickson, a 54-year-old Darwin resident suffering from lung cancer, the NT Rights of Terminally Ill law means he can get on with living without the haunting fear of his suffering: a terrifying death from his breathing condition. “I’m not afraid of dying from a spiritual point of view, but what I was afraid of was how I’d go, because I’ve watched people die in the hospital fighting for oxygen and clawing at their masks,” he says.
51.	From the second paragraph we learn that ________.
[A] the objection to euthanasia is slow to come in other countries
[B] physicians and citizens share the same view on euthanasia
[C] changing technology is chiefly responsible for the hasty passage of the law
[D] it takes time to realize the significance of the law’s passage
52.	When the author says that observers are waiting for the dominoes to start falling, he means ________.
[A] observers are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the future of euthanasia
[B] similar bills are likely to be passed in the US, Canada and other countries
[C] observers are waiting to see the result of the game of dominoes
[D] the effect-taking process of the passed bill may finally come to a stop
53.	When Lloyd Nickson dies, he will ________.
[A] face his death with calm characteristic of euthanasia
[B] experience the suffering of a lung cancer patient
[C] have an intense fear of terrible suffering
[D] undergo a cooling off period of seven days
54.	The author’s attitude towards euthanasia seems to be that of ________.
[A] opposition
[B] suspicion
[C] approval
[D] indifference

A report consistently brought back by visitors to the US is how friendly, courteous, and helpful most Americans were to them. To be fair, this observation is also frequently made of Canada and Canadians, and should best be considered North American. There are, of course, exceptions. Small-minded officials, rude waiters, and ill-mannered taxi drivers are hardly unknown in the US. Yet it is an observation made so frequently that it deserves comment.
For a long period of time and in many parts of the country, a traveler was a welcome break in an otherwise dull existence. Dullness and loneliness were common problems of the families who generally lived distant from one another. Strangers and travelers were welcome sources of diversion, and brought news of the outside world.
The harsh realities of the frontier also shaped this tradition of hospitality. Someone traveling alone, if hungry, injured, or ill, often had nowhere to turn except to the nearest cabin or settlement. It was not a matter of choice for the traveler or merely a charitable impulse on the part of the settlers. It reflected the harshness of daily life: if you didn’t take in the stranger and take care of him, there was no one else who would. And someday, remember, you might be in the same situation.
Today there are many charitable organizations which specialize in helping the weary traveler. Yet, the old tradition of hospitality to strangers is still very strong in the US, especially in the smaller cities and towns away from the busy tourist trails. “I was just traveling through, got talking with this American, and pretty soon he invited me home for dinner -- amazing.” Such observations reported by visitors to the US are not uncommon, but are not always understood properly. The casual friendliness of many Americans should be interpreted neither as superficial nor as artificial, but as the result of a historically developed cultural tradition.
As is true of any developed society, in America a complex set of cultural signals, assumptions, and conventions underlies all social interrelationships. And, of course, speaking a language does not necessarily mean that someone understands social and cultural patterns. Visitors who fail to “translate” cultural meanings properly often draw wrong conclusions. For example, when an American uses the word “friend,” the cultural implications of the word may be quite different from those it has in the visitor’s language and culture. It takes more than a brief encounter on a bus to distinguish between courteous convention and individual interest. Yet, being friendly is a virtue that many Americans value highly and expect from both neighbors and strangers.
55.	In the eyes of visitors from the outside world, ________.
[A] rude taxi drivers are rarely seen in the US
[B] small-minded officials deserve a serious comment
[C] Canadians are not so friendly as their neighbors
[D] most Americans are ready to offer help
56.	It could be inferred from the last paragraph that ________.
[A] culture exercises an influence over social interrelationship
[B] courteous convention and individual interest are interrelated
[C] various virtues manifest themselves exclusively among friends
[D] social interrelationships equal the complex set of cultural conventions
57.	Families in frontier settlements used to entertain strangers ________.
[A] to improve their hard life
[B] in view of their long-distance travel
[C] to add some flavor to their own daily life
[D] out of a charitable impulse
58.	The tradition of hospitality to strangers ________.
[A] tends to be superficial and artificial
[B] is generally well kept up in the United States
[C] is always understood properly
[D] has something to do with the busy tourist trails

Technically, any substance other than food that alters our bodily or mental functioning is a drug. Many people mistakenly believe the term drug refers only to some sort of medicine or an illegal chemical taken by drug addicts. They don’t realize that familiar substances such as alcohol and tobacco are also drugs. This is why the more neutral term substance is now used by many physicians and psychologists. The phrase “substance abuse” is often used instead of “drug abuse” to make clear that substances such as alcohol and tobacco can be just as harmfully misused as heroin and cocaine.
We live in a society in which the medicinal and social use of substances (drugs) is pervasive: an aspirin to quiet a headache, some wine to be sociable, coffee to get going in the morning, a cigarette for the nerves. When do these socially acceptable and apparently constructive uses of a substance become misuses? First of all, most substances taken in excess will produce negative effects such as poisoning or intense perceptual distortions. Repeated use of a substance can also lead to physical addiction or substance dependence. Dependence is marked first by an increased tolerance, with more and more of the substance required to produce the desired effect, and then by the appearance of unpleasant withdrawal symptoms when the substance is discontinued.
Drugs (substances) that affect the central nervous system and alter perception, mood, and behavior are known as psychoactive substances. Psychoactive substances are commonly grouped according to whether they are stimulants, depressants, or hallucinogens. Stimulants initially speed up or activate the central nervous system, whereas depressants slow it down. Hallucinogens have their primary effect on perception, distorting and altering it in a variety of ways including producing hallucinations. These are the substances often called psychedelic (from the Greek word meaning “mind-manifesting”) because they seemed to radically alter one’s state of consciousness.
59.	“Substance abuse” (Line 5, Paragraph 1) is preferable to “drug abuse” in that ________.
[A] substances can alter our bodily or mental functioning if illegally used
[B] “drug abuse” is only related to a limited number of drug takers
[C] alcohol and tobacco are as fatal as heroin and cocaine
[D] many substances other than heroin or cocaine can also be poisonous
60.	The word “pervasive” (Line 1, Paragraph 2) might mean ________.
[A] widespread
[B] overwhelming
[C] piercing
[D] fashionable
61.	Physical dependence on certain substances results from ________.
[A] uncontrolled consumption of them over long periods of time
[B] exclusive use of them for social purposes
[C] quantitative application of them to the treatment of diseases
[D] careless employment of them for unpleasant symptoms
62.	From the last paragraph we can infer that ________.
[A] stimulants function positively on the mind
[B] hallucinogens are in themselves harmful to health
[C] depressants are the worst type of psychoactive substances
[D] the three types of psychoactive substances are commonly used in groups

No company likes to be told it is contributing to the moral decline of a nation. “Is this what you intended to accomplish with your careers?” Senator Robert Dole asked Time Warner executives last week. “You have sold your souls, but must you corrupt our nation and threaten our children as well?” At Time Warner, however, such questions are simply the latest manifestation of the soul-searching that has involved the company ever since the company was born in 1990. It’s a self-examination that has, at various times, involved issues of responsibility, creative freedom and the corporate bottom line.
At the core of this debate is chairman Gerald Levin, 56, who took over for the late Steve Ross in 1992. On the financial front, Levin is under pressure to raise the stock price and reduce the company’s mountainous debt, which will increase to $17.3 billion after two new cable deals close. He has promised to sell off some of the property and restructure the company, but investors are waiting impatiently.
The flap over rap is not making life any easier for him. Levin has consistently defended the company’s rap music on the grounds of expression. In 1992, when Time Warner was under fire for releasing Ice-T’s violent rap song Cop Killer, Levin described rap as a lawful expression of street culture, which deserves an outlet. “The test of any democratic society,” he wrote in a Wall Street Journal column, “lies not in how well it can control expression but in whether it gives freedom of thought and expression the widest possible latitude, however disputable or irritating the results may sometimes be. We won’t retreat in the face of any threats.”
Levin would not comment on the debate last week, but there were signs that the chairman was backing off his hard-line stand, at least to some extent. During the discussion of rock singing verses at last month’s stockholders’ meeting, Levin asserted that “music is not the cause of society’s ills” and even cited his son, a teacher in the Bronx, New York, who uses rap to communicate with students. But he talked as well about the “balanced struggle” between creative freedom and social responsibility, and he announced that the company would launch a drive to develop standards for distribution and labeling of potentially objectionable music.
The 15-member Time Warner board is generally supportive of Levin and his corporate strategy. But insiders say several of them have shown their concerns in this matter. “Some of us have known for many, many years that the freedoms under the First Amendment are not totally unlimited,” says Luce. “I think it is perhaps the case that some people associated with the company have only recently come to realize this.”
63.	Senator Robert Dole criticized Time Warner for ________.
[A] its raising of the corporate stock price
[B] its self-examination of soul
[C] its neglect of social responsibility
[D] its emphasis on creative freedom
64.	According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE?
[A] Luce is a spokesman of Time Warner.
[B] Gerald Levin is liable to compromise.
[C] Time Warner is united as one in the face of the debate.
[D] Steve Ross is no longer alive.
65.	In face of the recent attacks on the company, the chairman ________.
[A] stuck to a strong stand to defend freedom of expression
[B] softened his tone and adopted some new policy
[C] changed his attitude and yielded to objection
[D] received more support from the 15-member board
66.	The best title for this passage could be ________.
[A] A Company under Fire
[B] A Debate on Moral Decline
[C] A Lawful Outlet of Street Culture
[D] A Form of Creative Freedom

Much of the language used to describe monetary policy, such as “steering the economy to a soft landing” or “a touch on the brakes,” makes it sound like a precise science. Nothing could be further from the truth. The link between interest rates and inflation is uncertain. And there are long, variable lags before policy changes have any effect on the economy. Hence the analogy that likens the conduct of monetary policy to driving a car with a blackened windscreen, a cracked rear-view mirror and a faulty steering wheel.
Given all these disadvantages, central bankers seem to have had much to boast about of late. Average inflation in the big seven industrial economies fell to a mere 2.3% last year, close to its lowest level in 30 years, before rising slightly to 2.5% this July. This is a long way below the double-digit rates which many countries experienced in the 1970s and early 1980s.
It is also less than most forecasters had predicted. In late 1994 the panel of economists which The Economist polls each month said that America’s inflation rate would average 3.5% in 1995. In fact, it fell to 2.6% in August, and is expected to average only about 3% for the year as a whole. In Britain and Japan inflation is running half a percentage point below the rate predicted at the end of last year. This is no flash in the pan; over the past couple of years, inflation has been consistently lower than expected in Britain and America.
Economists have been particularly surprised by favorable inflation figures in Britain and the United States, since conventional measures suggest that both economies, and especially America’s, have little productive slack. America’s capacity utilization, for example, hit historically high levels earlier this year, and its jobless rate (5.6% in August) has fallen below most estimates of the natural rate of unemployment -- the rate below which inflation has taken off in the past.
Why has inflation proved so mild? The most thrilling explanation is, unfortunately, a little defective. Some economists argue that powerful structural changes in the world have upended the old economic models that were based upon the historical link between growth and inflation.
67.	From the passage we learn that ________.
[A] there is a definite relationship between inflation and interest rates
[B] economy will always follow certain models
[C] the economic situation is better than expected
[D] economists had foreseen the present economic situation
68.	According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE?
[A] Making monetary policies is comparable to driving a car
[B] An extremely low jobless rate will lead to inflation
[C] A high unemployment rate will result from inflation
[D] Interest rates have an immediate effect on the economy
69.	The sentence “This is no flash in the pan” (Line 5, Paragraph 3) means that ________.
[A] the low inflation rate will last for some time
[B] the inflation rate will soon rise
[C] the inflation will disappear quickly
[D] there is no inflation at present
70.	The passage shows that the author is ________ the present situation.
[A] critical of
[B] puzzled by
[C] disappointed at
[D] amazed at

Do animals have rights? This is how the question is usually put. It sounds like a useful, ground-clearing way to start. 71) Actually, it isn’t, because it assumes that there is an agreed account of human rights, which is something the world does not have.
On one view of rights, to be sure, it necessarily follows that animals have none. 72) Some philosophers argue that rights exist only within a social contract, as part of an exchange of duties and entitlements. Therefore, animals cannot have rights. The idea of punishing a tiger that kills somebody is absurd, for exactly the same reason, so is the idea that tigers have rights. However, this is only one account, and by no means an uncontested one. It denies rights not only to animals but also to some people -- for instance, to infants, the mentally incapable and future generations. In addition, it is unclear what force a contract can have for people who never consented to it: how do you reply to somebody who says “I don’t like this contract”?
The point is this: without agreement on the rights of people, arguing about the rights of animals is fruitless. 73) It leads the discussion to extremes at the outset: it invites you to think that animals should be treated either with the consideration humans extend to other humans, or with no consideration at all. This is a false choice. Better to start with another, more fundamental, question: is the way we treat animals a moral issue at all?
Many deny it. 74) Arguing from the view that humans are different from animals in every relevant respect, extremists of this kind think that animals lie outside the area of moral choice. Any regard for the suffering of animals is seen as a mistake -- a sentimental displacement of feeling that should properly be directed to other humans.
This view, which holds that torturing a monkey is morally equivalent to chopping wood, may seem bravely “logical.” In fact it is simply shallow: the confused center is right to reject it. The most elementary form of moral reasoning -- the ethical equivalent of learning to crawl -- is to weigh others’ interests against one’s own. This in turn requires sympathy and imagination: without which there is no capacity for moral thought. To see an animal in pain is enough, for most, to engage sympathy. 75) When that happens, it is not a mistake: it is mankind’s instinct for moral reasoning in action, an instinct that should be encouraged rather than laughed at.

例文一
We meet smokers everywhere: in the streets, on college campuses and in shops. There are 5.8 billion people in the world, and the smokers are about 1.1 billion, which makes up 20 percent of the world’s total population.
Smoking is very harmful. I think there are two main aspects to the damage. First, smoking consumes a great deal of money. As is shown in the pictorial graph, smoking wastes 200 billion dollars each year in the world. Second, smoking does harm to the health of smokers, and it is the main cause of lung cancer. About 3 million people die because of the relevant diseases derived from smoking every year.
Because more and more people are aware of the great harm of smoking to humans, the amount of tobacco consumption is on the decrease. From the following figures we can clearly see the tendency. The total amount of world tobacco production added up to 14.364 billion pounds in 1994, but it dropped to 14.2 billion pounds in 1995. At the same time, many countries call on people to give up smoking. So it is certain that the number of smokers is to decrease.
例文二
About Tobacco Consumption
From the above set of pictures, we can see that there were a total of 14.364 billion pounds of tobacco produced in 1994 and 14.2 billion pounds in 1995. Because the amount of tobacco production is falling yearly, it can be predicted that the tendency of tobacco consumption would also be falling yearly. There are many reasons. Firstly, smoking wastes money. Every year there are two hundred billion dollars “burnt” in the cigarette “fire.” Secondly, smoking would hardly do people any good and it can even cause cancer. Every year there are three million people “buried” in the cigarette “tomb”.
Although tobacco consumption is falling, there are too many people who smoke. The population in the world is 5.8 billion, but about twenty percent of the population, that is to say 1.1 billion people, smoke. So the situation is serious and the movement against smoking is still a difficult task.

Text 1
Few creations of big technology capture the imagination like giant dams. Perhaps it is humankind’s long suffering at the mercy of flood and drought that makes the idea of forcing the waters to do our bidding so fascinating. But to be fascinated is also, sometimes, to be blind. Several giant dam projects threaten to do more harm than good.
The lesson from dams is that big is not always beautiful. It doesn’t help that building a big, powerful dam has become a symbol of achievement for nations and people striving to assert themselves. Egypt’s leadership in the Arab world was cemented by the Aswan High Dam. Turkey’s bid for First World status includes the giant Ataturk Dam.
But big dams tend not to work as intended. The Aswan Dam, for example, stopped the Nile flooding but deprived Egypt of the fertile silt that floods left -- all in return for a giant reservoir of disease which is now so full of silt that it barely generates electricity.
And yet, the myth of controlling the waters persists. This week, in the heart of civilized Europe, Slovaks and Hungarians stopped just short of sending in the troops in their contention over a dam on the Danube. The huge complex will probably have all the usual problems of big dams. But Slovakia is bidding for independence from the Czechs, and now needs a dam to prove itself.
Meanwhile, in India, the World Bank has given the go-ahead to the even more wrong-headed Narmada Dam. And the bank has done this even though its advisors say the dam will cause hardship for the powerless and environmental destruction. The benefits are for the powerful, but they are far from guaranteed.
Proper, scientific study of the impacts of dams and of the cost and benefits of controlling water can help to resolve these conflicts. Hydroelectric power and flood control and irrigation are possible without building monster dams. But when you are dealing with myths, it is hard to be either proper, or scientific. It is time that the world learned the lessons of Aswan. You don’t need a dam to be saved.

Text 2
Well, no gain without pain, they say. But what about pain without gain? Everywhere you go in America, you hear tales of corporate revival. What is harder to establish is whether the productivity revolution that businessmen assume they are presiding over is for real.
The official statistics are mildly discouraging. They show that, if you lump manufacturing and services together, productivity has grown on average by 1.2% since 1987. That is somewhat faster than the average during the previous decade. And since 1991, productivity has increased by about 2% a year, which is more than twice the 1978-87 average. The trouble is that part of the recent acceleration is due to the usual rebound that occurs at this point in a business cycle, and so is not conclusive evidence of a revival in the underlying trend. There is, as Robert Rubin, the treasury secretary, says, a “disjunction” between the mass of business anecdote that points to a leap in productivity and the picture reflected by the statistics.
Some of this can be easily explained. New ways of organizing the workplace -- all that re-engineering and downsizing -- are only one contribution to the overall productivity of an economy, which is driven by many other factors such as joint investment in equipment and machinery, new technology, and investment in education and training. Moreover, most of the changes that companies make are intended to keep them profitable, and this need not always mean increasing productivity: switching to new markets or improving quality can matter just as much.
Two other explanations are more speculative. First, some of the business restructuring of recent years may have been ineptly done. Second, even if it was well done, it may have spread much less widely than people suppose.
Leonard Schlesinger, a Harvard academic and former chief executive of Au Bong Pain, a rapidly growing chain of bakery cafes, says that much “re-engineering” has been crude. In many cases, he believes, the loss of revenue has been greater than the reductions in cost. His colleague, Michael Beer, says that far too many companies have applied re-engineering in a mechanistic fashion, chopping out costs without giving sufficient thought to long-term profitability. BBDO’s Al Rosenshine is blunter. He dismisses a lot of the work of re-engineering consultants as mere rubbish -- “the worst sort of ambulance chasing.”
55.	According to the author, the American economic situation is ________.
[A] not as good as it seems
[B] at its turning point
[C] much better than it seems
[D] near to complete recovery
56.	The official statistics on productivity growth ________.
[A] exclude the usual rebound in a business cycle
[B] fall short of businessmen’s anticipation
[C] meet the expectation of business people
[D] fail to reflect the true state of economy
57.	The author raises the question “what about pain without gain?” because ________.
[A] he questions the truth of “no gain without pain”
[B] he does not think the productivity revolution works
[C] he wonders if the official statistics are misleading
[D] he has conclusive evidence for the revival of businesses
58.	Which of the following statements is NOT mentioned in the passage?
[A] Radical reforms are essential for the increase of productivity.
[B] New ways of organizing workplaces may help to increase productivity.
[C] The reduction of costs is not a sure way to gain long-term profitability.
[D] The consultants are a bunch of good-for-nothings.

Science has long had an uneasy relationship with other aspects of culture. Think of Gallileo’s 17th-century trial for his rebelling belief before the Catholic Church or poet William Blake’s harsh remarks against the mechanistic worldview of Isaac Newton. The schism between science and the humanities has, if anything, deepened in this century.
Until recently, the scientific community was so powerful that it could afford to ignore its critics -- but no longer. As funding for science has declined, scientists have attacked “anti-science” in several books, notably Higher Superstition, by Paul R. Gross, a biologist at the University of Virginia, and Norman Levitt, a mathematician at Rutgers University; and The Demon-Haunted World, by Carl Sagan of Cornell University.
Defenders of science have also voiced their concerns at meetings such as “The Flight from Science and Reason,” held in New York City in 1995, and “Science in the Age of (Mis) information,” which assembled last June near Buffalo.
Anti-science clearly means different things to different people. Gross and Levitt find fault primarily with sociologists, philosophers and other academics who have questioned science’s objectivity. Sagan is more concerned with those who believe in ghosts, creationism and other phenomena that contradict the scientific worldview.
A survey of news stories in 1996 reveals that the anti-science tag has been attached to many other groups as well, from authorities who advocated the elimination of the last remaining stocks of smallpox virus to Republicans who advocated decreased funding for basic research.
Few would dispute that the term applies to the Unabomber, whose manifesto, published in 1995, scorns science and longs for return to a pre-technological utopia. But surely that does not mean environmentalists concerned about uncontrolled industrial growth are anti-science, as an essay in US News & World Report last May seemed to suggest.
The environmentalists, inevitably, respond to such critics. The true enemies of science, argues Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University, a pioneer of environmental studies, are those who question the evidence supporting global warming, the depletion of the ozone layer and other consequences of industrial growth.
Indeed, some observers fear that the anti-science epithet is in danger of becoming meaningless. “The term ‘anti-science’ can lump together too many, quite different things,” notes Harvard University philosopher Gerald Holton in his 1993 work Science and Anti-Science. “They have in common only one thing that they tend to annoy or threaten those who regard themselves as more enlightened.”
59.	The word “schism” (Line 4, Paragraph 1) in the context probably means ________.
[A] confrontation
[B] dissatisfaction
[C] separation
[D] contempt
60.	Paragraphs 2 and 3 are written to ________.
[A] discuss the cause of the decline of science’s power
[B] show the author’s sympathy with scientists

[D] exemplify the division of science and the humanities
61.	Which of the following is true according to the passage?
[A] Environmentalists were blamed for anti-science in an essay.
[B] Politicians are not subject to the labeling of anti-science.
[C] The “more enlightened” tend to tag others as anti-science.
[D] Tagging environmentalists as “anti-science” is justifiable.
62.	The author’s attitude toward the issue of “science vs. anti-science” is ________.
[A] impartial
[B] subjective
[C] biased
[D] puzzling

Emerging from the 1980 census is the picture of a nation developing more and more regional competition, as population growth in the Northeast and Midwest reaches a near standstill.
This development -- and its strong implications for US politics and economy in years ahead -- has enthroned the South as America’s most densely populated region for the first time in the history of the nation’s head counting.
Altogether, the US population rose in the 1970s by 23.2 million people -- numerically the third-largest growth ever recorded in a single decade. Even so, that gain adds up to only 11.4 percent, lowest in American annual records except for the Depression years.
Americans have been migrating south and west in larger numbers since World War II, and the pattern still prevails.
Three sun-belt states -- Florida, Texas and California -- together had nearly 10 million more people in 1980 than a decade earlier. Among large cities, San Diego moved from 14th to 8th and San Antonio from 15th to 10th -- with Cleveland and Washington. D. C., dropping out of the top 10.
Not all that shift can be attributed to the movement out of the snow belt, census officials say. Nonstop waves of immigrants played a role, too -- and so did bigger crops of babies as yesterday’s “baby boom” generation reached its child-bearing years.
Moreover, demographers see the continuing shift south and west as joined by a related but newer phenomenon: More and more, Americans apparently are looking not just for places with more jobs but with fewer people, too. Some instances―
■Regionally, the Rocky Mountain states reported the most rapid growth rate -- 37.1 percent since 1970 in a vast area with only 5 percent of the US population.
■Among states, Nevada and Arizona grew fastest of all: 63.5 and 53.1 percent respectively. Except for Florida and Texas, the top 10 in rate of growth is composed of Western states with 7.5 million people -- about 9 per square mile.
The flight from overcrowdedness affects the migration from snow belt to more bearable climates.
Nowhere do 1980 census statistics dramatize more the American search for spacious living than in the Far West. There, California added 3.7 million to its population in the 1970s, more than any other state.
In that decade, however, large numbers also migrated from California, mostly to other parts of the West. Often they chose -- and still are choosing -- somewhat colder climates such as Oregon, Idaho and Alaska in order to escape smog, crime and other plagues of urbanization in the Golden State.
As a result, California’s growth rate dropped during the 1970s, to 18.5 percent -- little more than two thirds the 1960s’ growth figure and considerably below that of other Western states.
63.	Discerned from the perplexing picture of population growth the 1980 census provided, America in 1970s ________.
[A] enjoyed the lowest net growth of population in history
[B] witnessed a southwestern shift of population
[C] underwent an unparalleled period of population growth
[D] brought to a standstill its pattern of migration since World War II
64.	The census distinguished itself from previous studies on population movement in that ________.
[A] it stresses the climatic influence on population distribution
[B] it highlights the contribution of continuous waves of immigrants
[C] it reveals the Americans’ new pursuit of spacious living
[D] it elaborates the delayed effects of yesterday’s “baby boom”
65.	We can see from the available statistics that ________.
[A] California was once the most thinly populated area in the whole US
[B] the top 10 states in growth rate of population were all located in the West
[C] cities with better climates benefited unanimously from migration
[D] Arizona ranked second of all states in its growth rate of population
66.	The word “demographers” (Line 1, Paragraph 8) most probably means ________.
[A] people in favor of the trend of democracy
[B] advocates of migration between states
[C] scientists engaged in the study of population
[D] conservatives clinging to old patterns of life
Text 5
Scattered around the globe are more than 100 small regions of isolated volcanic activity known to geologists as hot spots. Unlike most of the world’s volcanoes, they are not always found at the boundaries of the great drifting plates that make up the earth’s surface; on the contrary, many of them lie deep in the interior of a plate. Most of the hot spots move only slowly, and in some cases the movement of the plates past them has left trails of dead volcanoes. The hot spots and their volcanic trails are milestones that mark the passage of the plates.
That the plates are moving is now beyond dispute. Africa and South America, for example, are moving away from each other as new material is injected into the sea floor between them. The complementary coastlines and certain geological features that seem to span the ocean are reminders of where the two continents were once joined. The relative motion of the plates carrying these continents has been constructed in detail, but the motion of one plate with respect to another cannot readily be translated into motion with respect to the earth’s interior. It is not possible to determine whether both continents are moving in opposite directions or whether one continent is stationary and the other is drifting away from it. Hot spots, anchored in the deeper layers of the earth, provide the measuring instruments needed to resolve the question. From an analysis of the hot-spot population it appears that the African plate is stationary and that it has not moved during the past 30 million years.
The significance of hot spots is not confined to their role as a frame of reference. It now appears that they also have an important influence on the geophysical processes that propel the plates across the globe. When a continental plate come to rest over a hot spot, the material rising from deeper layers creates a broad dome. As the dome grows, it develops deep fissures (cracks); in at least a few cases the continent may break entirely along some of these fissures, so that the hot spot initiates the formation of a new ocean. Thus just as earlier theories have explained the mobility of the continents, so hot spots may explain their mutability (inconstancy).
67.	The author believes that ________.
[A] the motion of the plates corresponds to that of the earth’s interior
[B] the geological theory about drifting plates has been proved to be true
[C] the hot spots and the plates move slowly in opposite directions
[D] the movement of hot spots proves the continents are moving apart
68.	That Africa and South America were once joined can be deduced from the fact that ________.
[A] the two continents are still moving in opposite directions
[B] they have been found to share certain geological features
[C] the African plate has been stable for 30 million years
[D] over 100 hot spots are scattered all around the globe
69.	The hot spot theory may prove useful in explaining ________.
[A] the structure of the African plates
[B] the revival of dead volcanoes
[C] the mobility of the continents
[D] the formation of new oceans
70.	The passage is mainly about ________.
[A] the features of volcanic activities
[B] the importance of the theory about drifting plates
[C] the significance of hot spots in geophysical studies
[D] the process of the formation of volcanoes

They were, by far, the largest and most distant objects that scientists had ever detected: a strip of enormous cosmic clouds some 15 billion light-years from earth. 71) But even more important, it was the farthest that scientists had been able to look into the past, for what they were seeing were the patterns and structures that existed 15 billion years ago. That was just about the moment that the universe was born. What the researchers found was at once both amazing and expected: the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Cosmic Background Explorer satellite -- Cobe -- had discovered landmark evidence that the universe did in fact begin with the primeval explosion that has become known as the Big Bang (the theory that the universe originated in an explosion from a single mass of energy).
72) The existence of the giant clouds was virtually required for the Big Bang, first put forward in the 1920s, to maintain its reign as the dominant explanation of the cosmos. According to the theory, the universe burst into being as a submicroscopic, unimaginably dense knot of pure energy that flew outward in all directions, emitting radiation as it went, condensing into particles and then into atoms of gas. Over billions of years, the gas was compressed by gravity into galaxies, stars, plants and eventually, even humans.
Cobe is designed to see just the biggest structures, but astronomers would like to see much smaller hot spots as well, the seeds of local objects like clusters and superclusters of galaxies. They shouldn’t have long to wait. 73) Astrophysicists working with ground-based detectors at the South Pole and balloon-borne instruments are closing in on such structures, and may report their findings soon.
74) If the small hot spots look as expected, that will be a triumph for yet another scientific idea, a refinement of the Big Bang called the inflationary universe theory. Inflation says that very early on, the universe expanded in size by more than a trillion trillion trillion trillionfold in much less than a second, propelled by a sort of antigravity. 75) Odd though it sounds, cosmic inflation is a scientifically plausible consequence of some respected ideas in elementary particle physics, and many astrophysicists have been convinced for the better part of a decade that it is true.

With the development of the society and the improvement of people’s living standard, more and more attention should be paid to the improvement of quality of service. Therefore, many enterprises and departments promise to better their services so as to meet the people’s need better. They are also pleased to invite people to supervise what they have done and will do. But much to our surprise, some of them just say something that they should do. These promises are only laughed at by people.
(解释配诗, 又有议论)
In my opinion, doing more is better than promising more, because people are willing to be served really. All we should lay more emphasis on what we do and how we can virtually improve the level of service. Only in this way can we make people satisfied with what we do.

Text 1
It’s a rough world out there. Step outside and you could break a leg slipping on your doormat. Light up the stove and you could burn down the house. Luckily, if the doormat or stove failed to warn of coming disaster, a successful lawsuit might compensate you for your troubles. Or so the thinking has gone since the early 1980s, when juries began holding more companies liable for their customers’ misfortunes.
Feeling threatened, companies responded by writing ever-longer warning labels, trying to anticipate every possible accident. Today, stepladders carry labels several inches long that warn, among other things, that you might -- surprise! -- fall off. The label on a child’s Batman cape cautions that the toy “does not enable user to fly.”
While warnings are often appropriate and necessary -- the dangers of drug interactions, for example -- and many are required by state or federal regulations, it isn’t clear that they actually protect the manufacturers and sellers from liability if a customer is injured. About 50 percent of the companies lose when injured customers take them to court.
Now the tide appears to be turning. As personal injury claims continue as before, some courts are beginning to side with defendants, especially in cases where a warning label probably wouldn’t have changed anything. In May, Julie Nimmons, president of Schutt Sports in Illinois, successfully fought a lawsuit involving a football player who was paralyzed in a game while wearing a Schutt helmet. “We’re really sorry he has become paralyzed, but helmets aren’t designed to prevent those kinds of injuries,” says Nimmons. The jury agreed that the nature of the game, not the helmet, was the reason for the athlete’s injury. At the same time, the American Law Institute -- a group of judges, lawyers, and academics whose recommendations carry substantial weight -- issued new guidelines for tort law stating that companies need not warn customers of obvious dangers or bombard them with a lengthy list of possible ones. “Important information can get buried in a sea of trivialities,” says a law professor at Cornell law School who helped draft the new guidelines. If the moderate end of the legal community has its way, the information on products might actually be provided for the benefit of customers and not as protection against legal liability.
51.	What were things like in 1980s when accidents happened?
[A] Customers might be relieved of their disasters through lawsuits.
[B] Injured customers could expect protection from the legal system.
[C] Companies would avoid being sued by providing new warnings.
[D] Juries tended to find fault with the compensations companies promised.
52.	Manufacturers as mentioned in the passage tend to ________.
[A] satisfy customers by writing long warnings on products
[B] become honest in describing the inadequacies of their products
[C] make the best use of labels to avoid legal liability
[D] feel obliged to view customers’ safety as their first concern
53.	The case of Schutt helmet demonstrated that ________.
[A] some injury claims were no longer supported by law
[B] helmets were not designed to prevent injuries
[C] product labels would eventually be discarded
[D] some sports games might lose popularity with athletes
54.	The author’s attitude towards the issue seems to be ________.
[A] biased
[B] indifferent
[C] puzzling
[D] objective

In the first year or so of Web business, most of the action has revolved around efforts to tap the consumer market. More recently, as the Web proved to be more than a fashion, companies have started to buy and sell products and services with one another. Such business-to-business sales make sense because businesspeople typically know what product they’re looking for.
Nonetheless, many companies still hesitate to use the Web because of doubts about its reliability. “Businesses need to feel they can trust the pathway between them and the supplier,” says senior analyst Blane Erwin of Forrester Research. Some companies are limiting the risk by conducting online transactions only with established business partners who are given access to the company’s private intranet.
Another major shift in the model for Internet commerce concerns the technology available for marketing. Until recently, Internet marketing activities have focused on strategies to “pull” customers into sites. In the past year, however, software companies have developed tools that allow companies to “push” information directly out to consumers, transmitting marketing messages directly to targeted customers. Most notably, the Pointcast Network uses a screen saver to deliver a continually updated stream of news and advertisements to subscribers’ computer monitors. Subscribers can customize the information they want to receive and proceed directly to a company’s Web site. Companies such as Virtual Vineyards are already starting to use similar technologies to push messages to customers about special sales, product offerings, or other events. But push technology has earned the contempt of many Web users. Online culture thinks highly of the notion that the information flowing onto the screen comes there by specific request. Once commercial promotion begins to fill the screen uninvited, the distinction between the Web and television fades. That’s a prospect that horrifies Net purists.
But it is hardly inevitable that companies on the Web will need to resort to push strategies to make money. The examples of Virtual Vineyards, Amazon.com, and other pioneers show that a Web site selling the right kind of products with the right mix of interactivity, hospitality, and security will attract online customers. And the cost of computing power continues to free fall, which is a good sign for any enterprise setting up shop in silicon. People looking back 5 or 10 years from now may well wonder why so few companies took the online plunge.
55.	We learn from the beginning of the passage that Web business ________.
[A] has been striving to expand its market
[B] intended to follow a fanciful fashion
[C] tried but in vain to control the market
[D] has been booming for one year or so
56.	Speaking of the online technology available for marketing, the author implies that ________.
[A] the technology is popular with many Web users
[B] businesses have faith in the reliability of online transactions
[C] there is a radical change in strategy
[D] it is accessible limitedly to established partners
57.	In the view of Net purists, ________.
[A] there should be no marketing messages in online culture
[B] money making should be given priority to on the Web
[C] the Web should be able to function as the television set
[D] there should be no online commercial information without requests
58.	We learn from the last paragraph that ________.
[A] pushing information on the Web is essential to Internet commerce
[B] interactivity, hospitality and security are important to online customers
[C] leading companies began to take the online plunge decades ago
[D] setting up shops in silicon is independent of the cost of computing power

An invisible border divides those arguing for computers in the classroom on the behalf of students’ career prospects and those arguing for computers in the classroom for broader reasons of radical educational reform. Very few writers on the subject have explored this distinction -- indeed, contradiction -- which goes to the heart of what is wrong with the campaign to put computers in the classroom.
An education that aims at getting a student a certain kind of job is a technical education, justified for reasons radically different from why education is universally required by law. It is not simply to raise everyone’s job prospects that all children are legally required to attend school into their teens. Rather, we have a certain conception of the American citizen, a character who is incomplete if he cannot competently assess how his livelihood and happiness are affected by things outside of himself. But this was not always the case; before it was legally required for all children to attend school until a certain age, it was widely accepted that some were just not equipped by nature to pursue this kind of education. With optimism characteristic of all industrialized countries, we came to accept that everyone is fit to be educated. Computer-education advocates forsake this optimistic notion for a pessimism that betrays their otherwise cheery outlook. Banking on the confusion between educational and vocational reasons for bringing computers into schools, computered advocates often emphasize the job prospects of graduates over their educational achievement.
There are some good arguments for a technical education given the right kind of student. Many European schools introduce the concept of professional training early on in order to make sure children are properly equipped for the professions they want to join. It is, however, presumptuous to insist that there will only be so many jobs for so many scientists, so many businessmen, so many accountants. Besides, this is unlikely to produce the needed number of every kind of professional in a country as large as ours and where the economy is spread over so many states and involves so many international corporations.
But, for a small group of students, professional training might be the way to go since well-developed skills, all other factors being equal, can be the difference between having a job and not. Of course, the basics of using any computer these days are very simple. It does not take a lifelong acquaintance to pick up various software programs. If one wanted to become a computer engineer, that is, of course, an entirely different story. Basic computer skills take -- at the very longest -- a couple of months to learn. In any case, basic computer skills are only complementary to the host of real skills that are necessary to becoming any kind of professional. It should be observed, of course, that no school, vocational or not, is helped by a confusion over its purpose.
59.	The author thinks the present rush to put computers in the classroom is ________.
[A] far-reaching
[B] dubiously oriented
[C] self-contradictory
[D] radically reformatory
60.	The belief that education is indispensable to all children ________.
[A] is indicative of a pessimism in disguise
[B] came into being along with the arrival of computers
[C] is deeply rooted in the minds of computered advocates
[D] originated from the optimistic attitude of industrialized countries
61.	It could be inferred from the passage that in the author’s country the European model of professional training is ________.
[A] dependent upon the starting age of candidates
[B] worth trying in various social sections
[C] of little practical value
[D] attractive to every kind of professional
62.	According to the author, basic computer skills should be ________.
[A] included as an auxiliary course in school
[B] highlighted in acquisition of professional qualifications
[C] mastered through a life-long course
[D] equally emphasized by any school, vocational or otherwise
Text 4
When a Scottish research team startled the world by revealing 3 months ago that it had cloned an adult sheep, President Clinton moved swiftly. Declaring that he was opposed to using this unusual animal husbandry technique to clone humans, he ordered that federal funds not be used for such an experiment -- although no one had proposed to do so -- and asked an independent panel of experts chaired by Princeton President Harold Shapiro to report back to the White House in 90 days with recommendations for a national policy on human cloning. That group -- the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) -- has been working feverishly to put its wisdom on paper, and at a meeting on 17 May, members agreed on a near-final draft of their recommendations.
NBAC will ask that Clinton’s 90-day ban on federal funds for human cloning be extended indefinitely, and possibly that it be made law. But NBAC members are planning to word the recommendation narrowly to avoid new restrictions on research that involves the cloning of human DNA or cells -- routine in molecular biology. The panel has not yet reached agreement on a crucial question, however, whether to recommend legislation that would make it a crime for private funding to be used for human cloning.
In a draft preface to the recommendations, discussed at the 17 May meeting, Shapiro suggested that the panel had found a broad consensus that it would be “morally unacceptable to attempt to create a human child by adult nuclear cloning.” Shapiro explained during the meeting that the moral doubt stems mainly from fears about the risk to the health of the child. The panel then informally accepted several general conclusions, although some details have not been settled.
NBAC plans to call for a continued ban on federal government funding for any attempt to clone body cell nuclei to create a child. Because current federal law already forbids the use of federal funds to create embryos (the earliest stage of human offspring before birth) for research or to knowingly endanger an embryo’s life, NBAC will remain silent on embryo research.
NBAC members also indicated that they will appeal to privately funded researchers and clinics not to try to clone humans by body cell nuclear transfer. But they were divided on whether to go further by calling for a federal law that would impose a complete ban on human cloning. Shapiro and most members favored an appeal for such legislation, but in a phone interview, he said this issue was still “up in the air.”
63.	We can learn from the first paragraph that ________.
[A] federal funds have been used in a project to clone humans
[B] the White House responded strongly to the news of cloning
[C] NBAC was authorized to control the misuse of cloning technique
[D] the White House has got the panel’s recommendations on cloning
64.	The panel agreed on all of the following except that ________.
[A] the ban on federal funds for human cloning should be made a law
[B] the cloning of human DNA is not to be put under more control
[C] it is criminal to use private funding for human cloning
[D] it would be against ethical values to clone a human being
65.	NBAC will leave the issue of embryo research undiscussed because ________.
[A] embryo research is just a current development of cloning
[B] the health of the child is not the main concern of embryo research
[C] an embryo’s life will not be endangered in embryo research
[D] the issue is explicitly stated and settled in the law
66.	It can be inferred from the last paragraph that ________.
[A] some NBAC members hesitate to ban human cloning completely
[B] a law banning human cloning is to be passed in no time
[C] privately funded researchers will respond positively to NBAC’s appeal
[D] the issue of human cloning will soon be settled

Science, in practice, depends far less on the experiments it prepares than on the preparedness of the minds of the men who watch the experiments. Sir Isaac Newton supposedly discovered gravity through the fall of an apple. Apples had been falling in many places for centuries and thousands of people had seen them fall. But Newton for years had been curious about the cause of the orbital motion of the moon and planets. What kept them in place? Why didn’t they fall out of the sky? The fact that the apple fell down toward the earth and not up into the tree answered the question he had been asking himself about those larger fruits of the heavens, the moon and the planets.
How many men would have considered the possibility of an apple falling up into the tree? Newton did because he was not trying to predict anything. He was just wondering. His mind was ready for the unpredictable. Unpredictability is part of the essential nature of research. If you don’t have unpredictable things, you don’t have research. Scientists tend to forget this when writing their cut and dried reports for the technical journals, but history is filled with examples of it.
In talking to some scientists, particularly younger ones, you might gather the impression that they find the “scientific method” a substitute for imaginative thought. I’ve attended research conferences where a scientist has been asked what he thinks about the advisability of continuing a certain experiment. The scientist has frowned, looked at the graphs, and said “the data are still inconclusive.” “We know that,” the men from the budget office have said, “but what do you think? Is it worthwhile going on? What do you think we might expect?” The scientist has been shocked at having even been asked to speculate.
What this amounts to, of course, is that the scientist has become the victim of his own writings. He has put forward unquestioned claims so consistently that he not only believes them himself, but has convinced industrial and business management that they are true. If experiments are planned and carried out according to plan as faithfully as the reports in the science journals indicate, then it is perfectly logical for management to expect research to produce results measurable in dollars and cents. It is entirely reasonable for auditors to believe that scientists who know exactly where they are going and how they will get there should not be distracted by the necessity of keeping one eye on the cash register while the other eye is on the microscope. Nor, if regularity and conformity to a standard pattern are as desirable to the scientist as the writing of his papers would appear to reflect, is management to be blamed for discriminating against the “odd balls” among researchers in favor of more conventional thinkers who “work well with the team.”
67.	The author wants to prove with the example of Isaac Newton that ________.
[A] inquiring minds are more important than scientific experiments
[B] science advances when fruitful researches are conducted
[C] scientists seldom forget the essential nature of research
[D] unpredictability weighs less than prediction in scientific research
68.	The author asserts that scientists ________.
[A] shouldn’t replace “scientific method” with imaginative thought
[B] shouldn’t neglect to speculate on unpredictable things
[C] should write more concise reports for technical journals
[D] should be confident about their research findings
69.	It seems that some young scientists ________.
[A] have a keen interest in prediction
[B] often speculate on the future
[C] think highly of creative thinking
[D] stick to “scientific method”
70.	The author implies that the results of scientific research ________.
[A] may not be as profitable as they are expected
[B] can be measured in dollars and cents
[C] rely on conformity to a standard pattern
[D] are mostly underestimated by management
Section IV	English-Chinese Translation
Directions:
Read the following passage carefully and then translate underlined sentences into Chinese. Your translation must be written clearly on ANSWER SHEET 2. (15 points)
71) While there are almost as many definitions of history as there are historians, modern practice most closely conforms to one that sees history as the attempt to recreate and explain the significant events of the past. Caught in the web of its own time and place, each generation of historians determines anew what is significant for it in the past. In this search the evidence found is always incomplete and scattered; it is also frequently partial or partisan. The irony of the historian’s craft is that its practitioners always know that their efforts are but contributions to an unending process.
72) Interest in historical methods has arisen less through external challenge to the validity of history as an intellectual discipline and more from internal quarrels among historians themselves. While history once revered its affinity to literature and philosophy, the emerging social sciences seemed to afford greater opportunities for asking new questions and providing rewarding approaches to an understanding of the past. Social science methodologies had to be adapted to a discipline governed by the primacy of historical sources rather than the imperatives of the contemporary world. 73) During this transfer, traditional historical methods were augmented by additional methodologies designed to interpret the new forms of evidence in the historical study.
Methodology is a term that remains inherently ambiguous in the historical profession. 74) There is no agreement whether methodology refers to the concepts peculiar to historical work in general or to the research techniques appropriate to the various branches of historical inquiry. Historians, especially those so blinded by their research interests that they have been accused of “tunnel method,” frequently fall victim to the “technicist fallacy.” Also common in the natural sciences, the technicist fallacy mistakenly identifies the discipline as a whole with certain parts of its technical implementation.
75) It applies equally to traditional historians who view history as only the external and internal criticism of sources, and to social science historians who equate their activity with specific techniques.

The two graphs tell us something about population growth and wildlife extinction in the U.S. From 1800, the American population has been growing all the time. In the 100 years from 1600 to 1700, the number of wildlife species remained almost stable, with the next 200 years witnessing a growing trend in wildlife extinction. It can be easily seen that the more the human beings, the fewer the animal species.
There may be several reasons for this effect. First, as human population expands, more and more wild animals are hunted for food. Second, due to all kinds of pollution and the damage of ecosystem caused by man, some animals have nowhere to live. Third, some animals are of great medical value, they become the targets for making money.
It is time we took some measures to stop this disturbing trend. On one hand, government should pass some laws and regulations to prevent people from killing more wild animals and forbid further damage to our environment. On the other hand, we should cultivate the awareness that animals are our friends and their extinction poses a threat rather than brings benefits to us. Only when human beings live in harmony with all kinds of animals can we really build a beautiful and healthy world.

Text 1
A history of long and effortless success can be a dreadful handicap, but, if properly handled, it may become a driving force. When the United States entered just such a glowing period after the end of the Second World War, it had a market eight times larger than any competitor, giving its industries unparalleled economies of scale. Its scientists were the world’s best, its workers the most skilled. America and Americans were prosperous beyond the dreams of the Europeans and Asians whose economies the war had destroyed.
It was inevitable that this primacy should have narrowed as other countries grew richer. Just as inevitably, the retreat from predominance proved painful. By the mid-1980s Americans had found themselves at a loss over their fading industrial competitiveness. Some huge American industries, such as consumer electronics, had shrunk or vanished in the face of foreign competition. By 1987 there was only one American television maker left, Zenith. (Now there is none: Zenith was bought by South Korea’s LG Electronics in July.) Foreign-made cars and textiles were sweeping into the domestic market. America’s machine-tool industry was on the ropes. For a while it looked as though the making of semiconductors, which America had invented and which sat at the heart of the new computer age, was going to be the next casualty.
All of this caused a crisis of confidence. Americans stopped taking prosperity for granted. They began to believe that their way of doing business was failing, and that their incomes would therefore shortly begin to fall as well. The mid-1980s brought one inquiry after another into the causes of America’s industrial decline. Their sometimes sensational findings were filled with warnings about the growing competition from overseas.
How things have changed! In 1995 the United States can look back on five years of solid growth while Japan has been struggling. Few Americans attribute this solely to such obvious causes as a devalued dollar or the turning of the business cycle. Self-doubt has yielded to blind pride. “American industry has changed its structure, has gone on a diet, has learnt to be more quick-witted,” according to Richard Cavanagh, executive dean of Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. “It makes me proud to be an American just to see how our businesses are improving their productivity,” says Stephen Moore of the Cato Institute, a think-tank in Washington, DC. And William Sahlman of the Harvard Business School believes that people will look back on this period as “a golden age of business management in the United States.”
51.	The U.S. achieved its predominance after World War II because ________.
[A] it had made painstaking efforts towards this goal
[B] its domestic market was eight times larger than before
[C] the war had destroyed the economies of most potential competitors

[B] semiconductor industry had been taken over by foreign enterprises
[C] machine-tool industry had collapsed after suicidal actions
[D] auto industry had lost part of its domestic market
53.	What can be inferred from the passage?

[B] Intense competition may contribute to economic progress.
[C] The revival of the economy depends on international cooperation.
[D] A long history of success may pave the way for further development.

Being a man has always been dangerous. There are about 105 males born for every 100 females, but this ratio drops to near balance at the age of maturity, and among 70-year-olds there are twice as many women as men. But the great universal of male mortality is being changed. Now, boy babies survive almost as well as girls do. This means that, for the first time, there will be an excess of boys in those crucial years when they are searching for a mate. More important, another chance for natural selection has been removed. Fifty years ago, the chance of a baby (particularly a boy baby) surviving depended on its weight. A kilogram too light or too heavy meant almost certain death. Today it makes almost no difference. Since much of the variation is due to genes, one more agent of evolution has gone.
There is another way to commit evolutionary suicide: stay alive, but have fewer children. Few people are as fertile as in the past. Except in some religious communities, very few women have 15 children. Nowadays the number of births, like the age of death, has become average. Most of us have roughly the same number of offspring. Again, differences between people and the opportunity for natural selection to take advantage of it have diminished. India shows what is happening. The country offers wealth for a few in the great cities and poverty for the remaining tribal peoples. The grand mediocrity of today -- everyone being the same in survival and number of offspring -- means that natural selection has lost 80% of its power in upper-middle-class India compared to the tribes.
For us, this means that evolution is over; the biological Utopia has arrived. Strangely, it has involved little physical change. No other species fills so many places in nature. But in the pass 100,000 years -- even the pass 100 years -- our lives have been transformed but our bodies have not. We did not evolve, because machines and society did it for us. Darwin had a phrase to describe those ignorant of evolution: they “look at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as at something wholly beyond his comprehension.” No doubt we will remember a 20th century way of life beyond comprehension for its ugliness. But however amazed our descendants may be at how far from Utopia we were, they will look just like us.
55.	What used to be the danger in being a man according to the first paragraph?
[A] A lack of mates.
[B] A fierce competition.
[C] A lower survival rate.
[D] A defective gene.
56.	What does the example of India illustrate?
[A] Wealthy people tend to have fewer children than poor people.
[B] Natural selection hardly works among the rich and the poor.
[C] The middle class population is 80% smaller than that of the tribes.
[D] India is one of the countries with a very high birth rate.
57.	The author argues that our bodies have stopped evolving because ________.
[A] life has been improved by technological advance
[B] the number of female babies has been declining
[C] our species has reached the highest stage of evolution
[D] the difference between wealth and poverty is disappearing
58.	Which of the following would be the best title for the passage?
[A] Sex Ratio Changes in Human Evolution
[B] Ways of Continuing Man’s Evolution
[C] The Evolutionary Future of Nature
[D] Human Evolution Going Nowhere

When a new movement in art attains a certain fashion, it is advisable to find out what its advocates are aiming at, for, however farfetched and unreasonable their principles may seem today, it is possible that in years to come they may be regarded as normal. With regard to Futurist poetry, however, the case is rather difficult, for whatever Futurist poetry may be -- even admitting that the theory on which it is based may be right -- it can hardly be classed as Literature.
This, in brief, is what the Futurist says; for a century, past conditions of life have been conditionally speeding up, till now we live in a world of noise and violence and speed. Consequently, our feelings, thoughts and emotions have undergone a corresponding change. This speeding up of life, says the Futurist, requires a new form of expression. We must speed up our literature too, if we want to interpret modern stress. We must pour out a large stream of essential words, unhampered by stops, or qualifying adjectives, or finite verbs. Instead of describing sounds we must make up words that imitate them; we must use many sizes of type and different colored inks on the same page, and shorten or lengthen words at will.
Certainly their descriptions of battles are confused. But it is a little upsetting to read in the explanatory notes that a certain line describes a fight between a Turkish and a Bulgarian officer on a bridge off which they both fall into the river -- and then to find that the line consists of the noise of their falling and the weights of the officers: “Pluff! Pluff! A hundred and eighty-five kilograms.”
This, though it fulfills the laws and requirements of Futurist poetry, can hardly be classed as Literature. All the same, no thinking man can refuse to accept their first proposition: that a great change in our emotional life calls for a change of expression. The whole question is really this: have we essentially changed?
59.	This passage is mainly ________.
[A] a survey of new approaches to art
[B] a review of Futurist poetry
[C] about merits of the Futurist movement
[D] about laws and requirements of literature
60.	When a novel literary idea appears, people should try to ________.
[A] determine its purposes
[B] ignore its flaws
[C] follow the new fashions
[D] accept the principles
61.	Futurists claim that we must ________.
[A] increase the production of literature
[B] use poetry to relieve modern stress
[C] develop new modes of expression
[D] avoid using adjectives and verbs
62.	The author believes that Futurist poetry is ________.
[A] based on reasonable principles
[B] new and acceptable to ordinary people
[C] indicative of basic change in human nature
[D] more of a transient phenomenon than literature
Text 4
Aimlessness has hardly been typical of the postwar Japan whose productivity and social harmony are the envy of the United States and Europe. But increasingly the Japanese are seeing a decline of the traditional work-moral values. Ten years ago young people were hardworking and saw their jobs as their primary reason for being, but now Japan has largely fulfilled its economic needs, and young people don’t know where they should go next.
The coming of age of the postwar baby boom and an entry of women into the male-dominated job market have limited the opportunities of teenagers who are already questioning the heavy personal sacrifices involved in climbing Japan’s rigid social ladder to good schools and jobs. In a recent survey, it was found that only 24.5 percent of Japanese students were fully satisfied with school life, compared with 67.2 percent of students in the United States. In addition, far more Japanese workers expressed dissatisfaction with their jobs than did their counterparts in the 10 other countries surveyed.
While often praised by foreigners for its emphasis on the basics, Japanese education tends to stress test taking and mechanical learning over creativity and self-expression. “Those things that do not show up in the test scores -- personality, ability, courage or humanity -- are completely ignored,” says Toshiki Kaifu, chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s education committee. “Frustration against this kind of thing leads kids to drop out and run wild.” Last year Japan experienced 2,125 incidents of school violence, including 929 assaults on teachers. Amid the outcry, many conservative leaders are seeking a return to the prewar emphasis on moral education. Last year Mitsuo Setoyama, who was then education minister, raised eyebrows when he argued that liberal reforms introduced by the American occupation authorities after World War II had weakened the “Japanese morality of respect for parents.”
But that may have more to do with Japanese life-styles. “In Japan,” says educator Yoko Muro, “it’s never a question of whether you enjoy your job and your life, but only how much you can endure.” With economic growth has come centralization; fully 76 percent of Japan’s 119 million citizens live in cities where community and the extended family have been abandoned in favor of isolated, two-generation households. Urban Japanese have long endured lengthy commutes (travels to and from work) and crowded living conditions, but as the old group and family values weaken, the discomfort is beginning to tell. In the past decade, the Japanese divorce rate, while still well below that of the United States, has increased by more than 50 percent, and suicides have increased by nearly one-quarter.
63.	In the Westerner’s eyes, the postwar Japan was ________.
[A] under aimless development
[B] a positive example
[C] a rival to the West
[D] on the decline
64.	According to the author, what may chiefly be responsible for the moral decline of Japanese society?
[A] Women’s participation in social activities is limited.
[B] More workers are dissatisfied with their jobs.
[C] Excessive emphasis has been placed on the basics.
[D] The life-style has been influenced by Western values.
65.	Which of the following is true according to the author?
[A] Japanese education is praised for helping the young climb the social ladder.
[B] Japanese education is characterized by mechanical learning as well as creativity.
[C] More stress should be placed on the cultivation of creativity.
[D] Dropping out leads to frustration against test taking.
66.	The change in Japanese life-style is revealed in the fact that ________.
[A] the young are less tolerant of discomforts in life
[B] the divorce rate in Japan exceeds that in the U.S.
[C] the Japanese endure more than ever before
[D] the Japanese appreciate their present life
Text 5
If ambition is to be well regarded, the rewards of ambition -- wealth, distinction, control over one’s destiny -- must be deemed worthy of the sacrifices made on ambition’s behalf. If the tradition of ambition is to have vitality, it must be widely shared; and it especially must be highly regarded by people who are themselves admired, the educated not least among them. In an odd way, however, it is the educated who have claimed to have given up on ambition as an ideal. What is odd is that they have perhaps most benefited from ambition -- if not always their own then that of their parents and grandparents. There is heavy note of hypocrisy in this, a case of closing the barn door after the horses have escaped -- with the educated themselves riding on them.
Certainly people do not seem less interested in success and its signs now than formerly. Summer homes, European travel, BMWs -- the locations, place names and name brands may change, but such items do not seem less in demand today than a decade or two years ago. What has happened is that people cannot confess fully to their dreams, as easily and openly as once they could, lest they be thought pushing, acquisitive and vulgar. Instead, we are treated to fine hypocritical spectacles, which now more than ever seem in ample supply: the critic of American materialism with a Southampton summer home; the publisher of radical books who takes his meals in three-star restaurants; the journalist advocating participatory democracy in all phases of life, whose own children are enrolled in private schools. For such people and many more perhaps not so exceptional, the proper formulation is, “Succeed at all costs but avoid appearing ambitious.”
The attacks on ambition are many and come from various angles; its public defenders are few and unimpressive, where they are not extremely unattractive. As a result, the support for ambition as a healthy impulse, a quality to be admired and fixed in the mind of the young, is probably lower than it has ever been in the United States. This does not mean that ambition is at an end, that people no longer feel its stirrings and promptings, but only that, no longer openly honored, it is less openly professed. Consequences follow from this, of course, some of which are that ambition is driven underground, or made sly. Such, then, is the way things stand: on the left angry critics, on the right stupid supporters, and in the middle, as usual, the majority of earnest people trying to get on in life.
67.	It is generally believed that ambition may be well regarded if ________.
[A] its returns well compensate for the sacrifices
[B] it is rewarded with money, fame and power
[C] its goals are spiritual rather than material
[D] it is shared by the rich and the famous
68.	The last sentence of the first paragraph most probably implies that it is ________.
[A] customary of the educated to discard ambition in words
[B] too late to check ambition once it has been let out
[C] dishonest to deny ambition after the fulfillment of the goal
[D] impractical for the educated to enjoy benefits from ambition
69.	Some people do not openly admit they have ambition because ________.
[A] they think of it as immoral
[B] their pursuits are not fame or wealth
[C] ambition is not closely related to material benefits
[D] they do not want to appear greedy and contemptible
70.	From the last paragraph the conclusion can be drawn that ambition should be maintained ________.
[A] secretly and vigorously
[B] openly and enthusiastically
[C] easily and momentarily
[D] verbally and spiritually
Section IV	English-Chinese Translation
Directions:
Read the following passage carefully and then translate the underlined sentences into Chinese. Your translation must be written clearly on ANSWER SHEET 2. (15 points)
Governments throughout the world act on the assumption that the welfare of their people depends largely on the economic strength and wealth of the community. 71) Under modern conditions, this requires varying measures of centralized control and hence the help of specialized scientists such as economists and operational research experts. 72) Furthermore, it is obvious that the strength of a country’s economy is directly bound up with the efficiency of its agriculture and industry, and that this in turn rests upon the efforts of scientists and technologists of all kinds. It also means that governments are increasingly compelled to interfere in these sectors in order to step up production and ensure that it is utilized to the best advantage. For example, they may encourage research in various ways, including the setting up of their own research centers; they may alter the structure of education, or interfere in order to reduce the wastage of natural resources or tap resources hitherto unexploited; or they may cooperate directly in the growing number of international projects related to science, economics and industry. In any case, all such interventions are heavily dependent on scientific advice and also scientific and technological manpower of all kinds.
73) Owing to the remarkable development in mass-communications, people everywhere are feeling new wants and are being exposed to new customs and ideas, while governments are often forced to introduce still further innovations for the reasons given above. At the same time, the normal rate of social change throughout the world is taking place at a vastly accelerated speed compared with the past. For example, 74) in the early industrialized countries of Europe the process of industrialization -- with all the far-reaching changes in social patterns that followed -- was spread over nearly a century, whereas nowadays a developing nation may undergo the same process in a decade or so. All this has the effect of building up unusual pressures and tensions within the community and consequently presents serious problems for the governments concerned. 75) Additional social stresses may also occur because of the population explosion or problems arising from mass migration movements -- themselves made relatively easy nowadays by modern means of transport. As a result of all these factors, governments are becoming increasingly dependent on biologists and social scientists for planning the appropriate programs and putting them into effect.

These two pictures display a sharp contrast: there were a lot of fish with one fishing boat in the sea in 1900 while the situation was just the opposite in 1995. Obviously, the fishing industry was facing a major problem, with all the ocean resources being exhausted so quickly.
The drawer is not exaggerating or joking about commercial fishing. On the contrary, he is seriously warning us that our way of thinking and ways of doing things are unreasonable and dangerous. Our resources are limited and our ecosystem needs careful consideration and protection. If we only care about the present, we will suffer in the future. It’s just like building friendship and saving money: the more you put into it, the more you can get; the more you take out, the less it is left.
Measures should be taken if such disappointing situation is to be avoided. I suggest that government make laws and regulations to guide and supervise people’s fishing activity, punishing those who only care about their own interest and bring harm to others and the environment. I also appeal to the public that money is not the only thing we can pursue and fish is not the only food we can eat. Whether for the benefit of the human race or for the interest of our own, we should show concern for others and make plans for the future. Only in this way can we live happily and affluently.

Text 1
Specialization can be seen as a response to the problem of an increasing accumulation of scientific knowledge. By splitting up the subject matter into smaller units, one man could continue to handle the information and use it as the basis for further research. But specialization was only one of a series of related developments in science affecting the process of communication. Another was the growing professionalisation of scientific activity.
No clear-cut distinction can be drawn between professionals and amateurs in science: exceptions can be found to any rule. Nevertheless, the word “amateur” does carry a connotation that the person concerned is not fully integrated into the scientific community and, in particular, may not fully share its values. The growth of specialization in the nineteenth century, with its consequent requirement of a longer, more complex training, implied greater problems for amateur participation in science. The trend was naturally most obvious in those areas of science based especially on a mathematical or laboratory training, and can be illustrated in terms of the development of geology in the United Kingdom.
A comparison of British geological publications over the last century and a half reveals not simply an increasing emphasis on the primacy of research, but also a changing definition of what constitutes an acceptable research paper. Thus, in the nineteenth century, local geological studies represented worthwhile research in their own right; but, in the twentieth century, local studies have increasingly become acceptable to professionals only if they incorporate, and reflect on, the wider geological picture. Amateurs, on the other hand, have continued to pursue local studies in the old way. The overall result has been to make entrance to professional geological journals harder for amateurs, a result that has been reinforced by the widespread introduction of refereeing, first by national journals in the nineteenth century and then by several local geological journals in the twentieth century. As a logical consequence of this development, separate journals have now appeared aimed mainly towards either professional or amateur readership. A rather similar process of differentiation has led to professional geologists coming together nationally within one or two specific societies, whereas the amateurs have tended either to remain in local societies or to come together nationally in a different way.
Although the process of professionalisation and specialization was already well under way in British geology during the nineteenth century, its full consequences were thus delayed until the twentieth century. In science generally, however, the nineteenth century must be reckoned as the crucial period for this change in the structure of science.
51.	The growth of specialization in the 19th century might be more clearly seen in sciences such as ________.
[A] sociology and chemistry
[B] physics and psychology
[C] sociology and psychology
[D] physics and chemistry
52.	We can infer from the passage that ________.
[A] there is little distinction between specialization and professionalisation
[B] amateurs can compete with professionals in some areas of science
[C] professionals tend to welcome amateurs into the scientific community
[D] amateurs have national academic societies but no local ones
53.	The author writes of the development of geology to demonstrate ________.
[A] the process of specialization and professionalisation
[B] the hardship of amateurs in scientific study
[C] the change of policies in scientific publications
[D] the discrimination of professionals against amateurs
54.	The direct reason for specialization is ________.
[A] the development in communication
[B] the growth of professionalisation
[C] the expansion of scientific knowledge
[D] the splitting up of academic societies

A great deal of attention is being paid today to the so-called digital divide -- the division of the world into the info (information) rich and the info poor. And that divide does exist today. My wife and I lectured about this looming danger twenty years ago. What was less visible then, however, were the new, positive forces that work against the digital divide. There are reasons to be optimistic.
There are technological reasons to hope the digital divide will narrow. As the Internet becomes more and more commercialized, it is in the interest of business to universalize access -- after all, the more people online, the more potential customers there are. More and more governments, afraid their countries will be left behind, want to spread Internet access. Within the next decade or two, one to two billion people on the planet will be netted together. As a result, I now believe the digital divide will narrow rather than widen in the years ahead. And that is very good news because the Internet may well be the most powerful tool for combating world poverty that we’ve ever had.
Of course, the use of the Internet isn’t the only way to defeat poverty. And the Internet is not the only tool we have. But it has enormous potential.
To take advantage of this tool, some impoverished countries will have to get over their outdated anti-colonial prejudices with respect to foreign investment. Countries that still think foreign investment is an invasion of their sovereignty might well study the history of infrastructure (the basic structural foundations of a society) in the United States. When the United States built its industrial infrastructure, it didn’t have the capital to do so. And that is why America’s Second Wave infrastructure -- including roads, harbors, highways, ports and so on -- were built with foreign investment. The English, the Germans, the Dutch and the French were investing in Britain’s former colony. They financed them. Immigrant Americans built them. Guess who owns them now? The Americans. I believe the same thing would be true in places like Brazil or anywhere else for that matter. The more foreign capital you have helping you build your Third Wave infrastructure, which today is an electronic infrastructure, the better off you’re going to be. That doesn’t mean lying down and becoming fooled, or letting foreign corporations run uncontrolled. But it does mean recognizing how important they can be in building the energy and telecom infrastructures needed to take full advantage of the Internet.
55.	Digital divide is something ________.
[A] getting worse because of the Internet
[B] the rich countries are responsible for
[C] the world must guard against
[D] considered positive today
56.	Governments attach importance to the Internet because it ________.
[A] offers economic potentials
[B] can bring foreign funds
[C] can soon wipe out world poverty
[D] connects people all over the world
57.	The writer mentioned the case of the United States to justify the policy of ________.
[A] providing financial support overseas
[B] preventing foreign capital’s control
[C] building industrial infrastructure
[D] accepting foreign investment
58.	It seems that now a country’s economy depends much on ________.
[A] how well-developed it is electronically
[B] whether it is prejudiced against immigrants
[C] whether it adopts America’s industrial pattern
[D] how much control it has over foreign corporations

Why do so many Americans distrust what they read in their newspapers? The American Society of Newspaper Editors is trying to answer this painful question. The organization is deep into a long self-analysis known as the journalism credibility project.
Sad to say, this project has turned out to be mostly low-level findings about factual errors and spelling and grammar mistakes, combined with lots of head-scratching puzzlement about what in the world those readers really want.
But the sources of distrust go way deeper. Most journalists learn to see the world through a set of standard templates (patterns) into which they plug each day’s events. In other words, there is a conventional story line in the newsroom culture that provides a backbone and a ready-made narrative structure for otherwise confusing news.
There exists a social and cultural disconnect between journalists and their readers, which helps explain why the “standard templates” of the newsroom seem alien to many readers. In a recent survey, questionnaires were sent to reporters in five middle-size cities around the country, plus one large metropolitan area. Then residents in these communities were phoned at random and asked the same questions.
Replies show that compared with other Americans, journalists are more likely to live in upscale neighborhoods, have maids, own Mercedeses, and trade stocks, and they’re less likely to go to church, do volunteer work, or put down roots in a community.
Reporters tend to be part of a broadly defined social and cultural elite, so their work tends to reflect the conventional values of this elite. The astonishing distrust of the news media isn’t rooted in inaccuracy or poor reportorial skills but in the daily clash of world views between reporters and their readers.
This is an explosive situation for any industry, particularly a declining one. Here is a troubled business that keeps hiring employees whose attitudes vastly annoy the customers. Then it sponsors lots of symposiums and a credibility project dedicated to wondering why customers are annoyed and fleeing in large numbers. But it never seems to get around to noticing the cultural and class biases that so many former buyers are complaining about. If it did, it would open up its diversity program, now focused narrowly on race and gender, and look for reporters who differ broadly by outlook, values, education, and class.
59.	What is the passage mainly about?
[A] needs of the readers all over the world
[B] causes of the public disappointment about newspapers
[C] origins of the declining newspaper industry
[D] aims of a journalism credibility project
60.	The results of the journalism credibility project turned out to be ________.
[A] quite trustworthy
[B] somewhat contradictory
[C] very illuminating
[D] rather superficial
61.	The basic problem of journalists as pointed out by the writer lies in their ________.
[A] working attitude
[B] conventional lifestyle
[C] world outlook
[D] educational background
62.	Despite its efforts, the newspaper industry still cannot satisfy the readers owing to its ________.
[A] failure to realize its real problem
[B] tendency to hire annoying reporters
[C] likeliness to do inaccurate reporting
[D] prejudice in matters of race and gender

The world is going through the biggest wave of mergers and acquisitions ever witnessed. The process sweeps from hyperactive America to Europe and reaches the emerging countries with unsurpassed might. Many in these countries are looking at this process and worrying: “Won’t the wave of business concentration turn into an uncontrollable anti-competitive force?”
There’s no question that the big are getting bigger and more powerful. Multinational corporations accounted for less than 20% of international trade in 1982. Today the figure is more than 25% and growing rapidly. International affiliates account for a fast-growing segment of production in economies that open up and welcome foreign investment. In Argentina, for instance, after the reforms of the early 1990s, multinationals went from 43% to almost 70% of the industrial production of the 200 largest firms. This phenomenon has created serious concerns over the role of smaller economic firms, of national businessmen and over the ultimate stability of the world economy.
I believe that the most important forces behind the massive M&A wave are the same that underlie the globalization process: falling transportation and communication costs, lower trade and investment barriers and enlarged markets that require enlarged operations capable of meeting customer’s demands. All these are beneficial, not detrimental, to consumers. As productivity grows, the world’s wealth increases.
Examples of benefits or costs of the current concentration wave are scanty. Yet it is hard to imagine that the merger of a few oil firms today could re-create the same threats to competition that were feared nearly a century ago in the U.S., when the Standard Oil Trust was broken up. The mergers of telecom companies, such as WorldCom, hardly seem to bring higher prices for consumers or a reduction in the pace of technical progress. On the contrary, the price of communications is coming down fast. In cars, too, concentration is increasing -- witness Daimler and Chrysler, Renault and Nissan -- but it does not appear that consumers are being hurt.
Yet the fact remains that the merger movement must be watched. A few weeks ago, Alan Greenspan warned against the megamergers in the banking industry. Who is going to supervise, regulate and operate as lender of last resort with the gigantic banks that are being created? Won’t multinationals shift production from one place to another when a nation gets too strict about infringements to fair competition? And should one country take upon itself the role of “defending competition” on issues that affect many other nations, as in the U.S. vs. Microsoft case?
63.	What is the typical trend of businesses today?
[A] to take in more foreign funds
[B] to invest more abroad
[C] to combine and become bigger
[D] to trade with more countries
64.	According to the author, one of the driving forces behind M&A wave is ________.
[A] the greater customer demands
[B] a surplus supply for the market
[C] a growing productivity
[D] the increase of the world’s wealth
65.	From Paragraph 4 we can infer that ________.
[A] the increasing concentration is certain to hurt consumers
[B] WorldCom serves as a good example of both benefits and costs
[C] the costs of the globalization process are enormous
[D] the Standard Oil Trust might have threatened competition
66.	Toward the new business wave, the writer’s attitude can be said to be ________.
[A] optimistic
[B] objective
[C] pessimistic
[D] biased

When I decided to quit my full time employment it never occurred to me that I might become a part of a new international trend. A lateral move that hurt my pride and blocked my professional progress prompted me to abandon my relatively high profile career although, in the manner of a disgraced government minister, I covered my exit by claiming “I wanted to spend more time with my family”.
Curiously, some two-and-a-half years and two novels later, my experiment in what the Americans term “downshifting” has turned my tired excuse into an absolute reality. I have been transformed from a passionate advocate of the philosophy of “having it all,” preached by Linda Kelsey for the past seven years in the page of She magazine, into a woman who is happy to settle for a bit of everything.
I have discovered, as perhaps Kelsey will after her much-publicized resignation from the editorship of She after a build-up of stress, that abandoning the doctrine of “juggling your life,” and making the alternative move into “downshifting” brings with it far greater rewards than financial success and social status. Nothing could persuade me to return to the kind of life Kelsey used to advocate and I once enjoyed: 12-hour working days, pressured deadlines, the fearful strain of office politics and the limitations of being a parent on “quality time”.
In America, the move away from juggling to a simpler, less materialistic lifestyle is a well-established trend. Downshifting -- also known in America as “voluntary simplicity” -- has, ironically, even bred a new area of what might be termed anti-consumerism. There are a number of best-selling downshifting self-help books for people who want to simplify their lives; there are newsletters, such as The Tightwad Gazette, that give hundreds of thousands of Americans useful tips on anything from recycling their cling-film to making their own soap; there are even support groups for those who want to achieve the mid-’90s equivalent of dropping out.
While in America the trend started as a reaction to the economic decline -- after the mass redundancies caused by downsizing in the late ’80s -- and is still linked to the politics of thrift, in Britain, at least among the middle-class downshifters of my acquaintance, we have different reasons for seeking to simplify our lives.
For the women of my generation who were urged to keep juggling through the ’80s, downshifting in the mid-’90s is not so much a search for the mythical good life -- growing your own organic vegetables, and risking turning into one -- as a personal recognition of your limitations.
67.	Which of the following is true according to Paragraph 1?
[A] Full-time employment is a new international trend.
[B] The writer was compelled by circumstances to leave her job.
[C] “A lateral move” means stepping out of full-time employment.
[D] The writer was only too eager to spend more time with her family.
68.	The writer’s experiment shows that downshifting ________.
[A] enables her to realize her dream
[B] helps her mold a new philosophy of life
[C] prompts her to abandon her high social status
[D] leads her to accept the doctrine of She magazine
69.	“Juggling one’s life” probably means living a life characterized by ________.
[A] non-materialistic lifestyle
[B] a bit of everything
[C] extreme stress
[D] anti-consumerism
70.	According to the passage, downshifting emerged in the U.S. as a result of ________.
[A] the quick pace of modern life
[B] man’s adventurous spirit
[C] man’s search for mythical experiences
[D] the economic situation
Section IV	English-Chinese Translation
Directions:
Read the following passage carefully and then translate the underlined sentences into Chinese. Your translation must be written neatly on ANSWER SHEET 2. (15 points)
In less than 30 years’ time the Star Trek holodeck will be a reality. Direct links between the brain’s nervous system and a computer will also create full sensory virtual environments, allowing virtual vacations like those in the film Total Recall.
71) There will be television chat shows hosted by robots, and cars with pollution monitors that will disable them when they offend. 72) Children will play with dolls equipped with personality chips, computers with in-built personalities will be regarded as workmates rather than tools, relaxation will be in front of smell-television, and digital age will have arrived.
According to BT’s futurologist, Ian Pearson, these are among the developments scheduled for the first few decades of the new millennium (a period of 1,000 years), when supercomputers will dramatically accelerate progress in all areas of life.
73) Pearson has pieced together the work of hundreds of researchers around the world to produce a unique millennium technology calendar that gives the latest dates when we can expect hundreds of key breakthroughs and discoveries to take place. Some of the biggest developments will be in medicine, including an extended life expectancy and dozens of artificial organs coming into use between now and 2040.
Pearson also predicts a breakthrough in computer-human links. “By linking directly to our nervous system, computers could pick up what we feel and, hopefully, simulate feeling too so that we can start to develop full sensory environments, rather like the holidays in Total Recall or the Star Trek holodeck,” he says. 74) But that, Pearson points out, is only the start of man-machine integration: “It will be the beginning of the long process of integration that will ultimately lead to a fully electronic human before the end of the next century.”
Through his research, Pearson is able to put dates to most of the breakthroughs that can be predicted. However, there are still no forecasts for when faster-than-light travel will be available, or when human cloning will be perfected, or when time travel will be possible. But he does expect social problems as a result of technological advances. A boom in neighborhood surveillance cameras will, for example, cause problems in 2010, while the arrival of synthetic lifelike robots will mean people may not be able to distinguish between their human friends and the droids. 75) And home appliances will also become so smart that controlling and operating them will result in the breakout of a new psychological disorder -- kitchen rage.

This picture is a symbol that tells us how we should use our love: our love is like a lamp; the darker the place, the brighter the light. Indeed, love is most precious when it is offered to someone who is in difficulty.
I can tell you a real story here. When I was a child, my family moved to the countryside. Among our new neighbors was a paralyzed woman. As an innocent child, I somehow showed some interest in her. When I had time, I would to see her. When I had something to eat, I would let her share with me. One day she suddenly said to me, tear in her eyes, “I will bless you when I am in heaven.” I knew my love for her had worked wonders, for I had never heard her speaking and I thought she had lost her ability to speak. Her blessing may have really worked for I have been a lucky person in work and in life.
As far as I understand, love is sympathy and sincerity that needs not be expressed in terms of money or sweet words. As the proverb goes, “a hand may smell fragrant when it gives roses to others.” I believe love is the most precious thing in the world and we should give it to those who need it most.

Text 1
If you intend using humor in your talk to make people smile, you must know how to identify shared experiences and problems. Your humor must be relevant to the audience and should help to show them that you are one of them or that you understand their situation and are in sympathy with their point of view. Depending on whom you are addressing, the problems will be different. If you are talking to a group of managers, you may refer to the disorganized methods of their secretaries; alternatively if you are addressing secretaries, you may want to comment on their disorganized bosses.
Here is an example, which I heard at a nurses’ convention, of a story which works well because the audience all shared the same view of doctors. A man arrives in heaven and is being shown around by St. Peter. He sees wonderful accommodations, beautiful gardens, sunny weather, and so on. Everyone is very peaceful, polite and friendly until, waiting in a line for lunch, the new arrival is suddenly pushed aside by a man in a white coat, who rushes to the head of the line, grabs his food and stomps over to a table by himself. “Who is that?” the new arrival asked St. Peter. “Oh, that’s God,” came the reply, “but sometimes he thinks he’s a doctor.”
If you are part of the group, which you are addressing, you will be in a position to know the experiences and problems which are common to all of you and it’ll be appropriate for you to make a passing remark about the inedible canteen food or the chairman’s notorious bad taste in ties. With other audiences you mustn’t attempt to cut in with humor as they will resent an outsider making disparaging remarks about their canteen or their chairman. You will be on safer ground if you stick to scapegoats like the Post Office or the telephone system.
If you feel awkward being humorous, you must practice so that it becomes more natural. Include a few casual and apparently off-the-cuff remarks which you can deliver in a relaxed and unforced manner. Often it’s the delivery which causes the audience to smile, so speak slowly and remember that a raised eyebrow or an unbelieving look may help to show that you are making a light-hearted remark.
Look for the humor. It often comes from the unexpected. A twist on a familiar quote “If at first you don’t succeed, give up” or a play on words or on a situation. Search for exaggeration and understatements. Look at your talk and pick out a few words or sentences which you can turn about and inject with humor.
41.	To make your humor work, you should ________.
[A] take advantage of different kinds of audience
[B] make fun of the disorganized people
[C] address different problems to different people
[D] show sympathy for your listeners
42.	The joke about doctors implies that, in the eyes of nurses, they are ________.
[A] impolite to new arrivals
[B] very conscious of their godlike role
[C] entitled to some privileges
[D] very busy even during lunch hours
43.	It can be inferred from the text that public services ________.
[A] have benefited many people
[B] are the focus of public attention
[C] are an inappropriate subject for humor
[D] have often been the laughing stock
44.	To achieve the desired result, humorous stories should be delivered ________.
[A] in well-worded language
[B] as awkwardly as possible
[C] in exaggerated statements
[D] as casually as possible
45.	The best title for the text may be ________.
[A] Use Humor Effectively
[B] Various Kinds of Humor
[C] Add Humor to Speech
[D] Different Humor Strategies

Since the dawn of human ingenuity, people have devised ever more cunning tools to cope with work that is dangerous, boring, burdensome, or just plain nasty. That compulsion has resulted in robotics -- the science of conferring various human capabilities on machines. And if scientists have yet to create the mechanical version of science fiction, they have begun to come close.
As a result, the modern world is increasingly populated by intelligent gizmos whose presence we barely notice but whose universal existence has removed much human labor. Our factories hum to the rhythm of robot assembly arms. Our banking is done at automated teller terminals that thank us with mechanical politeness for the transaction. Our subway trains are controlled by tireless robot-drivers. And thanks to the continual miniaturization of electronics and micro-mechanics, there are already robot systems that can perform some kinds of brain and bone surgery with submillimeter accuracy -- far greater precision than highly skilled physicians can achieve with their hands alone.
But if robots are to reach the next stage of laborsaving utility, they will have to operate with less human supervision and be able to make at least a few decisions for themselves -- goals that pose a real challenge. “While we know how to tell a robot to handle a specific error,” says Dave Lavery, manager of a robotics program at NASA, “we can’t yet give a robot enough ‘common sense’ to reliably interact with a dynamic world.”
Indeed the quest for true artificial intelligence has produced very mixed results. Despite a spell of initial optimism in the 1960s and 1970s when it appeared that transistor circuits and microprocessors might be able to copy the action of the human brain by the year 2010, researchers lately have begun to extend that forecast by decades if not centuries.
What they found, in attempting to model thought, is that the human brain’s roughly one hundred billion nerve cells are much more talented -- and human perception far more complicated -- than previously imagined. They have built robots that can recognize the error of a machine panel by a fraction of a millimeter in a controlled factory environment. But the human mind can glimpse a rapidly changing scene and immediately disregard the 98 percent that is irrelevant, instantaneously focusing on the monkey at the side of a winding forest road or the single suspicious face in a big crowd. The most advanced computer systems on Earth can’t approach that kind of ability, and neuroscientists still don’t know quite how we do it.
46.	Human ingenuity was initially demonstrated in ________.
[A] the use of machines to produce science fiction
[B] the wide use of machines in manufacturing industry
[C] the invention of tools for difficult and dangerous work
[D] the elite’s cunning tackling of dangerous and boring work
47.	The word “gizmos” (Line 1, Paragraph 2) most probably means ________.
[A] programs
[B] experts
[C] devices
[D] creatures
48.	According to the text, what is beyond man’s ability now is to design a robot that can ________.
[A] fulfill delicate tasks like performing brain surgery
[B] interact with human beings verbally
[C] have a little common sense
[D] respond independently to a changing world
49.	Besides reducing human labor, robots can also ________.
[A] make a few decisions for themselves
[B] deal with some errors with human intervention
[C] improve factory environments
[D] cultivate human creativity
50.	The author uses the example of a monkey to argue that robots are ________.
[A] expected to copy human brain in internal structure
[B] able to perceive abnormalities immediately
[C] far less able than human brain in focusing on relevant information
[D] best used in a controlled environment

Could the bad old days of economic decline be about to return? Since OPEC agreed to supply-cuts in March, the price of crude oil has jumped to almost $26 a barrel, up from less than $10 last December. This near-tripling of oil prices calls up scary memories of the 1973 oil shock, when prices quadrupled, and 1979-80, when they also almost tripled. Both previous shocks resulted in double-digit inflation and global economic decline. So where are the headlines warning of gloom and doom this time?
The oil price was given another push up this week when Iraq suspended oil exports. Strengthening economic growth, at the same time as winter grips the northern hemisphere, could push the price higher still in the short term.
Yet there are good reasons to expect the economic consequences now to be less severe than in the 1970s. In most countries the cost of crude oil now accounts for a smaller share of the price of petrol than it did in the 1970s. In Europe, taxes account for up to four-fifths of the retail price, so even quite big changes in the price of crude have a more muted effect on pump prices than in the past.
Rich economies are also less dependent on oil than they were, and so less sensitive to swings in the oil price. Energy conservation, a shift to other fuels and a decline in the importance of heavy, energy-intensive industries have reduced oil consumption. Software, consultancy and mobile telephones use far less oil than steel or car production. For each dollar of GDP (in constant prices) rich economies now use nearly 50% less oil than in 1973. The OECD estimates in its latest Economic Outlook that, if oil prices averaged $22 a barrel for a full year, compared with $13 in 1998, this would increase the oil import bill in rich economies by only 0.25-0.5% of GDP. That is less than one-quarter of the income loss in 1974 or 1980. On the other hand, oil-importing emerging economies -- to which heavy industry has shifted -- have become more energy-intensive, and so could be more seriously squeezed.
One more reason not to lose sleep over the rise in oil prices is that, unlike the rises in the 1970s, it has not occurred against the background of general commodity-price inflation and global excess demand. A sizable portion of the world is only just emerging from economic decline. The Economist’s commodity price index is broadly unchanging from a year ago. In 1973 commodity prices jumped by 70%, and in 1979 by almost 30%.
51.	The main reason for the latest rise of oil price is ________.
[A] global inflation
[B] reduction in supply
[C] fast growth in economy
[D] Iraq’s suspension of exports
52.	It can be inferred from the text that the retail price of petrol will go up dramatically if ________.
[A] price of crude rises
[B] commodity prices rise
[C] consumption rises
[D] oil taxes rise
53.	The estimates in Economic Outlook show that in rich countries ________.
[A] heavy industry becomes more energy-intensive
[B] income loss mainly results from fluctuating crude oil prices
[C] manufacturing industry has been seriously squeezed
[D] oil price changes have no significant impact on GDP
54.	We can draw a conclusion from the text that ________.
[A] oil-price shocks are less shocking now
[B] inflation seems irrelevant to oil-price shocks
[C] energy conservation can keep down the oil prices
[D] the price rise of crude leads to the shrinking of heavy industry
55.	From the text we can see that the writer seems ________.
[A] optimistic
[B] sensitive
[C] gloomy
[D] scared

The Supreme Court’s decisions on physician-assisted suicide carry important implications for how medicine seeks to relieve dying patients of pain and suffering.
Although it ruled that there is no constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide, the Court in effect supported the medical principle of “double effect,” a centuries-old moral principle holding that an action having two effects -- a good one that is intended and a harmful one that is foreseen -- is permissible if the actor intends only the good effect.
Doctors have used that principle in recent years to justify using high doses of morphine to control terminally ill patients’ pain, even though increasing dosages will eventually kill the patient.
Nancy Dubler, director of Montefiore Medical Center, contends that the principle will shield doctors who “until now have very, very strongly insisted that they could not give patients sufficient mediation to control their pain if that might hasten death.”
George Annas, chair of the health law department at Boston University, maintains that, as long as a doctor prescribes a drug for a legitimate medical purpose, the doctor has done nothing illegal even if the patient uses the drug to hasten death. “It’s like surgery,” he says. “We don’t call those deaths homicides because the doctors didn’t intend to kill their patients, although they risked their death. If you’re a physician, you can risk your patient’s suicide as long as you don’t intend their suicide.”
On another level, many in the medical community acknowledge that the assisted-suicide debate has been fueled in part by the despair of patients for whom modern medicine has prolonged the physical agony of dying.
Just three weeks before the Court’s ruling on physician-assisted suicide, the National Academy of Science (NAS) released a two-volume report, Approaching Death: Improving Care at the End of Life. It identifies the undertreatment of pain and the aggressive use of “ineffectual and forced medical procedures that may prolong and even dishonor the period of dying” as the twin problems of end-of-life care.
The profession is taking steps to require young doctors to train in hospices, to test knowledge of aggressive pain management therapies, to develop a Medicare billing code for hospital-based care, and to develop new standards for assessing and treating pain at the end of life.
Annas says lawyers can play a key role in insisting that these well-meaning medical initiatives translate into better care. “Large numbers of physicians seem unconcerned with the pain their patients are needlessly and predictably suffering,” to the extent that it constitutes “systematic patient abuse.” He says medical licensing boards “must make it clear… that painful deaths are presumptively ones that are incompetently managed and should result in license suspension.”
56.	From the first three paragraphs, we learn that ________.
[A] doctors used to increase drug dosages to control their patients’ pain
[B] it is still illegal for doctors to help the dying end their lives
[C] the Supreme Court strongly opposes physician-assisted suicide

[D] A doctor’s medication is no longer justified by his intentions.
58.	According to the NAS’s report, one of the problems in end-of-life care is ________.
[A] prolonged medical procedures
[B] inadequate treatment of pain
[C] systematic drug abuse
[D] insufficient hospital care
59.	Which of the following best defines the word “aggressive” (Line 3, Paragraph 7)?
[A] Bold
[B] Harmful
[C] Careless
[D] Desperate
60.	George Annas would probably agree that doctors should be punished if they ________.
[A] manage their patients incompetently
[B] give patients more medicine than needed
[C] reduce drug dosages for their patients
[D] prolong the needless suffering of the patients

Almost all our major problems involve human behavior, and they cannot be solved by physical and biological technology alone. What is needed is a technology of behavior, but we have been slow to develop the science from which such a technology might be drawn. 61) One difficulty is that almost all of what is called behavioral science continues to trace behavior to states of mind, feelings, traits of character, human nature, and so on. Physics and biology once followed similar practices and advanced only when they discarded them. 62) The behavioral sciences have been slow to change partly because the explanatory items often seem to be directly observed and partly because other kinds of explanations have been hard to find. The environment is obviously important, but its role has remained obscure. It does not push or pull, it selects, and this function is difficult to discover and analyze. 63) The role of natural selection in evolution was formulated only a little more than a hundred years ago, and the selective role of the environment in shaping and maintaining the behavior of the individual is only beginning to be recognized and studied. As the interaction between organism and environment has come to be understood, however, effects once assigned to states of mind, feelings, and traits are beginning to be traced to accessible conditions, and a technology of behavior may therefore become available. It will not solve our problems, however, until it replaces traditional prescientific views, and these are strongly entrenched. Freedom and dignity illustrate the difficulty. 64) They are the possessions of the autonomous (self-governing) man of traditional theory, and they are essential to practices in which a person is held responsible for his conduct and given credit for his achievements. A scientific analysis shifts both the responsibility and the achievement to the environment. It also raises questions concerning “values.” Who will use a technology and to what ends? 65) Until these issues are resolved, a technology of behavior will continue to be rejected, and with it possibly the only way to solve our problems.

Cultures -- national and international
As is shown in the picture, a young American girl is wearing traditional Chinese dress and ornaments and is smiling sweetly. It may be an ordinary picture, but it conveys deep and profound meaning: national culture is also international culture.
Ever since we opened our door to the world, we have attracted and influenced by things from other cultures, such as jeans, country music and fast food. We have shown such interest in them that some people, especially the younger generation, become crazy about them. The more exotic they are, the more fashionable they seem to be. Now, national culture begun to show its charm and gain popularity all over the world. Our national costume, just as shown in the picture, Beijing Opera, Cross Talk, for example, have won favor with a lot of foreigners.
As national culture becomes international culture, people in the world better understand each other. We are all villagers in this global village. Mutual respect and understanding make this world a better place to live in.

Text 1
Wild Bill Donovan would have loved the Internet. The American spymaster who built the Office of Strategic Services in the World War II and later laid the roots for the CIA was fascinated with information. Donovan believed in using whatever tools came to hand in the “great game” of espionage -- spying as a “profession.” These days the Net, which has already re-made such everyday pastimes as buying books and sending mail, is reshaping Donovan’s vocation as well.
The latest revolution isn’t simply a matter of gentlemen reading other gentlemen’s e-mail. That kind of electronic spying has been going on for decades. In the past three or four years, the World Wide Web has given birth to a whole industry of point-and-click spying. The spooks call it “open-source intelligence,” and as the Net grows, it is becoming increasingly influential. In 1995 the CIA held a contest to see who could compile the most data about Burundi. The winner, by a large margin, was a tiny Virginia company called Open Source Solutions, whose clear advantage was its mastery of the electronic world.
Among the firms making the biggest splash in this new world is Straitford, Inc., a private intelligence-analysis firm based in Austin, Texas. Straitford makes money by selling the results of spying (covering nations from Chile to Russia) to corporations like energy-services firm McDermott International. Many of its predictions are available online at www.straitford.com.
Straitford president George Friedman says he sees the online world as a kind of mutually reinforcing tool for both information collection and distribution, a spymaster’s dream. Last week his firm was busy vacuuming up data bits from the far corners of the world and predicting a crisis in Ukraine. “As soon as that report runs, we’ll suddenly get 500 new Internet sign-ups from Ukraine,” says Friedman, a former political science professor. “And we’ll hear back from some of them.” Open-source spying does have its risks, of course, since it can be difficult to tell good information from bad. That’s where Straitford earns its keep.
Friedman relies on a lean staff of 20 in Austin. Several of his staff members have military-intelligence backgrounds. He sees the firm’s outsider status as the key to its success. Straitford’s briefs don’t sound like the usual Washington back-and-forthing, whereby agencies avoid dramatic declarations on the chance they might be wrong. Straitford, says Friedman, takes pride in its independent voice.
41.	The emergence of the Net has ________.
[A] received support from fans like Donovan
[B] remolded the intelligence services
[C] restored many common pastimes
[D] revived spying as a profession
42.	Donovan’s story is mentioned in the text to ________.
[A] introduce the topic of online spying
[B] show how he fought for the U.S.
[C] give an episode of the information war
[D] honor his unique services to the CIA
43.	The phrase “making the biggest splash” (Line 1, Paragraph 3) most probably means ________.
[A] causing the biggest trouble
[B] exerting the greatest effort
[C] achieving the greatest success
[D] enjoying the widest popularity
44.	It can be learned from Paragraph 4 that ________.
[A] Straitford’s prediction about Ukraine has proved true
[B] Straitford guarantees the truthfulness of its information
[C] Straitford’s business is characterized by unpredictability
[D] Straitford is able to provide fairly reliable information
45.	Straitford is most proud of its ________.
[A] official status
[B] nonconformist image
[C] efficient staff
[D] military background

To paraphrase 18th-century statesman Edmund Burke, “all that is needed for the triumph of a misguided cause is that good people do nothing.” One such cause now seeks to end biomedical research because of the theory that animals have rights ruling out their use in research. Scientists need to respond forcefully to animal rights advocates, whose arguments are confusing the public and thereby threatening advances in health knowledge and care. Leaders of the animal rights movement target biomedical research because it depends on public funding, and few people understand the process of health care research. Hearing allegations of cruelty to animals in research settings, many are perplexed that anyone would deliberately harm an animal.
For example, a grandmotherly woman staffing an animal rights booth at a recent street fair was distributing a brochure that encouraged readers not to use anything that comes from or is tested in animals―no meat, no fur, no medicines. Asked if she opposed immunizations, she wanted to know if vaccines come from animal research. When assured that they do, she replied, “Then I would have to say yes.” Asked what will happen when epidemics return, she said, “Don’t worry, scientists will find some way of using computers.” Such well-meaning people just don’t understand.
Scientists must communicate their message to the public in a compassionate, understandable way -- in human terms, not in the language of molecular biology. We need to make clear the connection between animal research and a grandmother’s hip replacement, a father’s bypass operation, a baby’s vaccinations, and even a pet’s shots. To those who are unaware that animal research was needed to produce these treatments, as well as new treatments and vaccines, animal research seems wasteful at best and cruel at worst.
Much can be done. Scientists could “adopt” middle school classes and present their own research. They should be quick to respond to letters to the editor, lest animal rights misinformation go unchallenged and acquire a deceptive appearance of truth. Research institutions could be opened to tours, to show that laboratory animals receive humane care. Finally, because the ultimate stakeholders are patients, the health research community should actively recruit to its cause not only well-known personalities such as Stephen Cooper, who has made courageous statements about the value of animal research, but all who receive medical treatment. If good people do nothing, there is a real possibility that an uninformed citizenry will extinguish the precious embers of medical progress.
46.	The author begins his article with Edmund Burke’s words to ________.
[A] call on scientists to take some actions
[B] criticize the misguided cause of animal rights
[C] warn of the doom of biomedical research
[D] show the triumph of the animal rights movement
47.	Misled people tend to think that using an animal in research is ________.
[A] cruel but natural
[B] inhuman and unacceptable
[C] inevitable but vicious
[D] pointless and wasteful
48.	The example of the grandmotherly woman is used to show the public’s ________.
[A] discontent with animal research
[B] ignorance about medical science
[C] indifference to epidemics
[D] anxiety about animal rights
49.	The author believes that, in face of the challenge from animal rights advocates, scientists should ________.
[A] communicate more with the public
[B] employ hi-tech means in research
[C] feel no shame for their cause
[D] strive to develop new cures
50.	From the text we learn that Stephen Cooper is ________.

Text 3
In recent years, railroads have been combining with each other, merging into supersystems, causing heightened concerns about monopoly. As recently as 1995, the top four railroads accounted for under 70 percent of the total ton-miles moved by rails. Next year, after a series of mergers is completed, just four railroads will control well over 90 percent of all the freight moved by major rail carriers.
Supporters of the new supersystems argue that these mergers will allow for substantial cost reductions and better coordinated service. Any threat of monopoly, they argue, is removed by fierce competition from trucks. But many shippers complain that for heavy bulk commodities traveling long distances, such as coal, chemicals, and grain, trucking is too costly and the railroads therefore have them by the throat.
The vast consolidation within the rail industry means that most shippers are served by only one rail company. Railroads typically charge such “captive” shippers 20 to 30 percent more than they do when another railroad is competing for the business. Shippers who feel they are being overcharged have the right to appeal to the federal government’s Surface Transportation Board for rate relief, but the process is expensive, time-consuming, and will work only in truly extreme cases.
Railroads justify rate discrimination against captive shippers on the grounds that in the long run it reduces everyone’s cost. If railroads charged all customers the same average rate, they argue, shippers who have the option of switching to trucks or other forms of transportation would do so, leaving remaining customers to shoulder the cost of keeping up the line. It’s a theory to which many economists subscribe, but in practice it often leaves railroads in the position of determining which companies will flourish and which will fail. “Do we really want railroads to be the arbiters of who wins and who loses in the marketplace?” asks Martin Bercovici, a Washington lawyer who frequently represents shippers.
Many captive shippers also worry they will soon be hit with a round of huge rate increases. The railroad industry as a whole, despite its brightening fortunes, still does not earn enough to cover the cost of the capital it must invest to keep up with its surging traffic. Yet railroads continue to borrow billions to acquire one another, with Wall Street cheering them on. Consider the $10.2 billion bid by Norfolk Southern and CSX to acquire Conrail this year. Conrail’s net railway operating income in 1996 was just $427 million, less than half of the carrying costs of the transaction. Who’s going to pay for the rest of the bill? Many captive shippers fear that they will, as Norfolk Southern and CSX increase their grip on the market.
51.	According to those who support mergers, railway monopoly is unlikely because ________.
[A] cost reduction is based on competition
[B] services call for cross-trade coordination
[C] outside competitors will continue to exist
[D] shippers will have the railway by the throat
52.	What is many captive shippers’ attitude towards the consolidation in the rail industry?
[A] Indifferent.
[B] Supportive.
[C] Indignant.
[D] Apprehensive.
53.	It can be inferred from Paragraph 3 that ________.
[A] shippers will be charged less without a rival railroad
[B] there will soon be only one railroad company nationwide
[C] overcharged shippers are unlikely to appeal for rate relief
[D] a government board ensures fair play in railway business
54.	The word “arbiters” (Line 7, Paragraph 4) most probably refers to those ________.
[A] who work as coordinators
[B] who function as judges
[C] who supervise transactions
[D] who determine the price
55.	According to the text, the cost increase in the rail industry is mainly caused by ________.
[A] the continuing acquisition
[B] the growing traffic
[C] the cheering Wall Street
[D] the shrinking market
Text 4
It is said that in England death is pressing, in Canada inevitable and in California optional. Small wonder. Americans’ life expectancy has nearly doubled over the past century. Failing hips can be replaced, clinical depression controlled, cataracts removed in a 30-minute surgical procedure. Such advances offer the aging population a quality of life that was unimaginable when I entered medicine 50 years ago. But not even a great health-care system can cure death -- and our failure to confront that reality now threatens this greatness of ours.
Death is normal; we are genetically programmed to disintegrate and perish, even under ideal conditions. We all understand that at some level, yet as medical consumers we treat death as a problem to be solved. Shielded by third-party payers from the cost of our care, we demand everything that can possibly be done for us, even if it’s useless. The most obvious example is late-stage cancer care. Physicians -- frustrated by their inability to cure the disease and fearing loss of hope in the patient -- too often offer aggressive treatment far beyond what is scientifically justified.
In 1950, the U.S. spent $12.7 billion on health care. In 2002, the cost will be $1,540 billion. Anyone can see this trend is unsustainable. Yet few seem willing to try to reverse it. Some scholars conclude that a government with finite resources should simply stop paying for medical care that sustains life beyond a certain age -- say 83 or so. Former Colorado governor Richard Lamm has been quoted as saying that the old and infirm “have a duty to die and get out of the way,” so that younger, healthier people can realize their potential.
I would not go that far. Energetic people now routinely work through their 60s and beyond, and remain dazzlingly productive. At 78, Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone jokingly claims to be 53. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor is in her 70s, and former surgeon general C. Everett Koop chairs an Internet start-up in his 80s. These leaders are living proof that prevention works and that we can manage the health problems that come naturally with age. As a mere 68-year-old, I wish to age as productively as they have.
Yet there are limits to what a society can spend in this pursuit. As a physician, I know the most costly and dramatic measures may be ineffective and painful. I also know that people in Japan and Sweden, countries that spend far less on medical care, have achieved longer, healthier lives than we have. As a nation, we may be overfunding the quest for unlikely cures while underfunding research on humbler therapies that could improve people’s lives.
56.	What is implied in the first sentence?
[A] Americans are better prepared for death than other people.
[B] Americans enjoy a higher life quality than ever before.
[C] Americans are over-confident of their medical technology.

Human beings in all times and places think about their world and wonder at their place in it. Humans are thoughtful and creative, possessed of insatiable curiosity. 61) Furthermore, humans have the ability to modify the environment in which they live, thus subjecting all other life forms to their own peculiar ideas and fancies. Therefore, it is important to study humans in all their richness and diversity in a calm and systematic manner, with the hope that the knowledge resulting from such studies can lead humans to a more harmonious way of living with themselves and with all other life forms on this planet Earth.
“Anthropology” derives from the Greek words anthropos: “human” and logos “the study of.” By its very name, anthropology encompasses the study of all humankind.
Anthropology is one of the social sciences. 62) Social science is that branch of intellectual enquiry which seeks to study humans and their endeavors in the same reasoned, orderly, systematic, and dispassioned manner that natural scientists use for the study of natural phenomena.
Social science disciplines include geography, economics, political science, psychology, and sociology. Each of these social sciences has a subfield or specialization which lies particularly close to anthropology.
All the social sciences focus upon the study of humanity. Anthropology is a field-study oriented discipline which makes extensive use of the comparative method in analysis. 63) The emphasis on data gathered first-hand, combined with a cross-cultural perspective brought to the analysis of cultures past and present, makes this study a unique and distinctly important social science.
Anthropological analyses rest heavily upon the concept of culture. Sir Edward Tylor’s formulation of the concept of culture was one of the great intellectual achievements of 19th century science. 64) Tylor defined culture as “… that complex whole which includes belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.” This insight, so profound in its simplicity, opened up an entirely new way of perceiving and understanding human life. Implicit within Tylor’s definition is the concept that culture is learned, shared, and patterned behavior.
65) Thus, the anthropological concept of “culture,” like the concept of “set” in mathematics, is an abstract concept which makes possible immense amounts of concrete research and understanding.

As is shown in the two pictures, the same flower has different fate when put in different situations. When there is protection, the flower blooms beautifully. However, when exposed directly to rain and storm, the flower quickly withers. We can safely come to the conclusion that greenhouse flowers cannot withstand rain and storm.
The same is true with our children. As the one-child policy is adopted in China, more and more parents overprotect their children. With everything done for them and every need satisfied by their parents or grandparents, these only children seem to be healthy, happy and high-spirited. But when they leave home, they become disappointed and frustrated. Facing harsh things they have never experienced before, such as competition from peers, criticism from supervisors, pressure for deadlines and restriction for discipline, they will be at a loss, miserable or even desperate. In fact, the more protection they get from their parents, the less ability they acquire. Parents’ love for their children turns out to be a disaster.
Children, like flowers, should be treated with care, but reasonable and sensible ways of doing things will help to bring about more fruitful results, if we not only love our children but also teach them how to love, our love will be passed down from generation to generation; if we not only solve problems for our children but also encourage them to solve problems, our diligence and ingenuity will make our life more meaningful and worthwhile.

Text 1
Hunting for a job late last year, lawyer Gant Redmon stumbled across CareerBuilder, a job database on the Internet. He searched it with no success but was attracted by the site’s “personal search agent.” It’s an interactive feature that lets visitors key in job criteria such as location, title, and salary, then E-mails them when a matching position is posted in the database. Redmon chose the keywords legal, intellectual property, and Washington, D.C. Three weeks later, he got his first notification of an opening. “I struck gold,” says Redmon, who E-mailed his resume to the employer and won a position as in-house counsel for a company.
With thousands of career-related sites on the Internet, finding promising openings can be time-consuming and inefficient. Search agents reduce the need for repeated visits to the databases. But although a search agent worked for Redmon, career experts see drawbacks. Narrowing your criteria, for example, may work against you: “Every time you answer a question you eliminate a possibility.” says one expert.
For any job search, you should start with a narrow concept―what you think you want to do -- then broaden it. “None of these programs do that,” says another expert. “There’s no career counseling implicit in all of this.” Instead, the best strategy is to use the agent as a kind of tip service to keep abreast of jobs in a particular database; when you get E-mail, consider it a reminder to check the database again. “I would not rely on agents for finding everything that is added to a database that might interest me,” says the author of a job-searching guide.
Some sites design their agents to tempt job hunters to return. When CareerSite’s agent sends out messages to those who have signed up for its service, for example, it includes only three potential jobs -- those it considers the best matches. There may be more matches in the database; job hunters will have to visit the site again to find them -- and they do. “On the day after we send our messages, we see a sharp increase in our traffic,” says Seth Peets, vice president of marketing for CareerSite.
Even those who aren’t hunting for jobs may find search agents worthwhile. Some use them to keep a close watch on the demand for their line of work or gather information on compensation to arm themselves when negotiating for a raise. Although happily employed, Redmon maintains his agent at CareerBuilder. “You always keep your eyes open,” he says. Working with a personal search agent means having another set of eyes looking out for you.
41.	How did Redmon find his job?
[A] By searching openings in a job database.
[B] By posting a matching position in a database.
[C] By using a special service of a database.
[D] By E-mailing his resume to a database.
42.	Which of the following can be a disadvantage of search agents?
[A] Lack of counseling.
[B] Limited number of visits.
[C] Lower efficiency.
[D] Fewer successful matches.
43.	The expression “tip service” (Line 4, Paragraph 3) most probably means ________.
[A] advisory
[B] compensation
[C] interaction
[D] reminder
44.	Why does CareerSite’s agent offer each job hunter only three job options?
[A] To focus on better job matches.
[B] To attract more returning visits.
[C] To reserve space for more messages.
[D] To increase the rate of success.
45.	Which of the following is true according to the text?
[A] Personal search agents are indispensable to job-hunters.
[B] Some sites keep E-mailing job seekers to trace their demands.
[C] Personal search agents are also helpful to those already employed.
[D] Some agents stop sending information to people once they are employed.

Over the past century, all kinds of unfairness and discrimination have been condemned or made illegal. But one insidious form continues to thrive: alphabetism. This, for those as yet unaware of such a disadvantage, refers to discrimination against those whose surnames begin with a letter in the lower half of the alphabet.
It has long been known that a taxi firm called AAAA cars has a big advantage over Zodiac cars when customers thumb through their phone directories. Less well known is the advantage that Adam Abbott has in life over Zo? Zysman. English names are fairly evenly spread between the halves of the alphabet. Yet a suspiciously large number of top people have surnames beginning with letters between A and K.
Thus the American president and vice-president have surnames starting with B and C respectively; and 26 of George Bush’s predecessors (including his father) had surnames in the first half of the alphabet against just 16 in the second half. Even more striking, six of the seven heads of government of the G7 rich countries are alphabetically advantaged (Berlusconi, Blair, Bush, Chirac, Chrétien and Koizumi). The world’s three top central bankers (Greenspan, Duisenberg and Hayami) are all close to the top of the alphabet, even if one of them really uses Japanese characters. As are the world’s five richest men (Gates, Buffett, Allen, Ellison and Albrecht).
Can this merely be coincidence? One theory, dreamt up in all the spare time enjoyed by the alphabetically disadvantaged, is that the rot sets in early. At the start of the first year in infant school, teachers seat pupils alphabetically from the front, to make it easier to remember their names. So short-sighted Zysman junior gets stuck in the back row, and is rarely asked the improving questions posed by those insensitive teachers. At the time the alphabetically disadvantaged may think they have had a lucky escape. Yet the result may be worse qualifications, because they get less individual attention, as well as less confidence in speaking publicly.
The humiliation continues. At university graduation ceremonies, the ABCs proudly get their awards first; by the time they reach the Zysmans most people are literally having a ZZZ. Shortlists for job interviews, election ballot papers, lists of conference speakers and attendees: all tend to be drawn up alphabetically, and their recipients lose interest as they plough through them.
46.	What does the author intend to illustrate with AAA A cars and Zodiac cars?
[A] A kind of overlooked inequality.
[B] A type of conspicuous bias.
[C] A type of personal prejudice.
[D] A kind of brand discrimination.
47.	What can we infer from the first three paragraphs?
[A] In both East and West, names are essential to success.
[B] The alphabet is to blame for the failure of Zo? Zysman.
[C] Customers often pay a lot of attention to companies’ names.
[D] Some form of discrimination is too subtle to recognize.
48.	The 4th paragraph suggests that ________.
[A] questions are often put to the more intelligent students
[B] alphabetically disadvantaged students often escape from class
[C] teachers should pay attention to all of their students
[D] students should be seated according to their eyesight
49.	What does the author mean by “most people are literally having a ZZZ” (Lines 2-3, Paragraph 5)?
[A] They are getting impatient.
[B] They are noisily dozing off.
[C] They are feeling humiliated.
[D] They are busy with word puzzles.
50.	Which of the following is true according to the text?
[A] People with surnames beginning with N to Z are often ill-treated.
[B] VIPs in the Western world gain a great deal from alphabetism.
[C] The campaign to eliminate alphabetism still has a long way to go.
[D] Putting things alphabetically may lead to unintentional bias.

When it comes to the slowing economy, Ellen Spero isn’t biting her nails just yet. But the 47-year-old manicurist isn’t cutting, filling or polishing as many nails as she’d like to, either. Most of her clients spend $12 to $50 weekly, but last month two longtime customers suddenly stopped showing up. Spero blames the softening economy. “I’m a good economic indicator,” she says. “I provide a service that people can do without when they’re concerned about saving some dollars.” So Spero is downscaling, shopping at middle-brow Dillard’s department store near her suburban Cleveland home, instead of Neiman Marcus. “I don’t know if other clients are going to abandon me, too.” she says.
Even before Alan Greenspan’s admission that America’s red-hot economy is cooling, lots of working folks had already seen signs of the slowdown themselves. From car dealerships to Gap outlets, sales have been lagging for months as shoppers temper their spending. For retailers, who last year took in 24 percent of their revenue between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the cautious approach is coming at a crucial time. Already, experts say, holiday sales are off 7 percent from last year’s pace. But don’t sound any alarms just yet. Consumers seem only mildly concerned, not panicked, and many say they remain optimistic about the economy’s long-term prospects, even as they do some modest belt-tightening.
Consumers say they’re not in despair because, despite the dreadful headlines, their own fortunes still feel pretty good. Home prices are holding steady in most regions. In Manhattan, “there’s a new gold rush happening in the $4 million to $10 million range, predominantly fed by Wall Street bonuses,” says broker Barbara Corcoran. In San Francisco, prices are still rising even as frenzied overbidding quiets. “Instead of 20 to 30 offers, now maybe you only get two or three,” says John Tealdi, a Bay Area real-estate broker. And most folks still feel pretty comfortable about their ability to find and keep a job.
Many folks see silver linings to this slowdown. Potential home buyers would cheer for lower interest rates. Employers wouldn’t mind a little fewer bubbles in the job market. Many consumers seem to have been influenced by stock-market swings, which investors now view as a necessary ingredient to a sustained boom. Diners might see an upside, too. Getting a table at Manhattan’s hot new Alain Ducasse restaurant used to be impossible. Not anymore. For that, Greenspan & Co. may still be worth toasting.
51.	By “Ellen Spero isn’t biting her nails just yet” (Lines 1-2, Paragraph 1), the author means ________.
[A] Spero can hardly maintain her business
[B] Spero is too much engaged in her work
[C] Spero has grown out of her bad habit
[D] Spero is not in a desperate situation
52.	How do the public feel about the current economic situation?
[A] Optimistic.
[B] Confused.
[C] Carefree.
[D] Panicked.
53.	When mentioning “the $4 million to $10 million range” (Lines 3-4, Paragraph 3) the author is talking about ________.
[A] gold market
[B] real estate
[C] stock exchange
[D] venture investment
54.	Why can many people see “silver linings” to the economic slowdown?
[A] They would benefit in certain ways.
[B] The stock market shows signs of recovery.
[C] Such a slowdown usually precedes a boom.
[D] The purchasing power would be enhanced.
55.	To which of the following is the author likely to agree?
[A] A new boom, on the horizon.
[B] Tighten the belt, the single remedy.
[C] Caution all right, panic not.
[D] The more ventures, the more chances.
Text 4
Americans today don’t place a very high value on intellect. Our heroes are athletes, entertainers, and entrepreneurs, not scholars. Even our schools are where we send our children to get a practical education -- not to pursue knowledge for the sake of knowledge. Symptoms of pervasive anti-intellectualism in our schools aren’t difficult to find.
“Schools have always been in a society where practical is more important than intellectual,” says education writer Diane Ravitch. “Schools could be a counterbalance.” Ravitch’s latest book, Left Back: A Century of Failed School Reforms, traces the roots of anti-intellectualism in our schools, concluding they are anything but a counterbalance to the American distaste for intellectual pursuits.
But they could and should be. Encouraging kids to reject the life of the mind  leaves them vulnerable to exploitation and control. Without the ability to think critically, to defend their ideas and understand the ideas of others, they cannot fully participate in our democracy. Continuing along this path, says writer Earl Shorris, “We will become a second-rate country. We will have a less civil society.”
“Intellect is resented as a form of power or privilege,” writes historian and professor Richard Hofstadter in Anti-Intellectualism in American Life, a Pulitzer-Prize winning book on the roots of anti-intellectualism in US politics, religion, and education. From the beginning of our history, says Hofstadter, our democratic and populist urges have driven us to reject anything that smells of elitism. Practicality, common sense, and native intelligence have been considered more noble qualities than anything you could learn from a book.
Ralph Waldo Emerson and other Transcendentalist philosophers thought schooling and rigorous book learning put unnatural restraints on children: “We are shut up in schools and college recitation rooms for 10 or 15 years and come out at last with a bellyful of words and do not know a thing.” Mark Twain’s Huckleberry Finn exemplified American anti-intellectualism. Its hero avoids being civilized -- going to school and learning to read -- so he can preserve his innate goodness.
Intellect, according to Hofstadter, is different from native intelligence, a quality we reluctantly admire. Intellect is the critical, creative, and contemplative side of the mind. Intelligence seeks to grasp, manipulate, re-order, and adjust, while intellect examines, ponders, wonders, theorizes, criticizes and imagines.
School remains a place where intellect is mistrusted. Hofstadter says our country’s educational system is in the grips of people who “joyfully and militantly proclaim their hostility to intellect and their eagerness to identify with children who show the least intellectual promise.”
56.	What do American parents expect their children to acquire in school?
[A] The habit of thinking independently.
[B] Profound knowledge of the world.
[C] Practical abilities for future career.
[D] The confidence in intellectual pursuits.
57.	We can learn from the text that Americans have a history of ________.
[A] undervaluing intellect
[B] favoring intellectualism
[C] supporting school reform
[D] suppressing native intelligence
58.	The views of Ravitch and Emerson on schooling are ________.
[A] identical
[B] similar
[C] complementary
[D] opposite
59.	Emerson, according to the text, is probably ________.
[A] a pioneer of education reform
[B] an opponent of intellectualism
[C] a scholar in favor of intellect
[D] an advocate of regular schooling
60.	What does the author think of intellect?
[A] It is second to intelligence.
[B] It evolves from common sense.
[C] It is to be pursued.
[D] It underlies power.

The relation of language and mind has interested philosophers for many centuries. 61) The Greeks assumed that the structure of language had some connection with the process of thought, which took root in Europe long before people realized how diverse languages could be.
Only recently did linguists begin the serious study of languages that were very different from their own. Two anthropologist-linguists, Franz Boas and Edward Sapir, were pioneers in describing many native languages of North and South America during the first half of the twentieth century. 62) We are obliged to them because some of these languages have since vanished, as the peoples who spoke them died out or became assimilated and lost their native languages. Other linguists in the earlier part of this century, however, who were less eager to deal with bizarre data from “exotic” language, were not always so grateful. 63) The newly described languages were often so strikingly different from the well studied languages of Europe and Southeast Asia that some scholars even accused Boas and Sapir of fabricating their data. Native American languages are indeed different, so much so in fact that Navajo could be used by the US military as a code during World War II to send secret messages.
Sapir’s pupil, Benjamin Lee Whorf, continued the study of American Indian languages. 64) Being interested in the relationship of language and thought, Whorf developed the idea that the structure of language determines the structure of habitual thought in a society. He reasoned that because it is easier to formulate certain concepts and not others in a given language, the speakers of that language think along one track and not along another. 65) Whorf came to believe in a sort of linguistic determinism which, in its strongest form, states that language imprisons the mind, and that the grammatical patterns in a language can produce far-reaching consequences for the culture of a society. Later, this idea became to be known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, but this term is somewhat inappropriate. Although both Sapir and Whorf emphasized the diversity of languages, Sapir himself never explicitly supported the notion of linguistic determinism.

Look at this picture. A man is running toward the end of a race, sweating all over. Perhaps there is nothing special about the man and the race, yet the end line leaves a deep impression on us for it is both “finish line” and “starting line” if we look at it from a different angle.
The picture tells us a lot about life. An ordinary runner may think that his achievement calls for celebration for he has reached his goal. But an ambitious runner will well realize that his success is the starting point for a new race. Obviously, the way we look at things determines how far we will go. If we feel satisfied with the ability to read and write, perhaps we will not strive to get a college education. Again, if we think a Bachelor's degree is quite enough, we will not take pains to pass the examination for postgraduate. Life is just like an endless race. If we don’t prepare for new races, we are either disqualified from the race or surpassed by others. That’s why the finish line is also a starting line.
I like this picture. I may have been running this endless race, but I have been pushed forward by my parents or people around me. From now on, I will become more active and take the initiative, for the picture has really enlightened me.

The human nose is an underrated tool. Humans are often thought to be insensitive smellers compared with animals, 大1家 this is largely because, 大2家 animals, we stand upright.

Text 1
Everybody loves a fat pay rise. Yet pleasure at your own can vanish if you learn that a colleague has been given a bigger one. Indeed, if he has a reputation for slacking, you might even be outraged. Such behaviour is regarded as “all too human,” with the underlying assumption that other animals would not be capable of this finely developed sense of grievance. But a study by Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, which has just been published in Nature, suggests that it is all too monkey, as well.
The researchers studied the behaviour of female brown capuchin monkeys. They look cute. They are good-natured, co-operative creatures, and they share their food readily. Above all, like their female human counterparts, they tend to pay much closer attention to the value of “goods and services” than males.
Such characteristics make them perfect candidates for Dr. Brosnan’s and Dr. de Waal’s study. The researchers spent two years teaching their monkeys to exchange tokens for food. Normally, the monkeys were happy enough to exchange pieces of rock for slices of cucumber. However, when two monkeys were placed in separate but adjoining chambers, so that each could observe what the other was getting in return for its rock, their behaviour became markedly different.
In the world of capuchins, grapes are luxury goods (and much preferable to cucumbers). So when one monkey was handed a grape in exchange for her token, the second was reluctant to hand hers over for a mere piece of cucumber. And if one received a grape without having to provide her token in exchange at all, the other either tossed her own token at the researcher or out of the chamber, or refused to accept the slice of cucumber. Indeed, the mere presence of a grape in the other chamber (without an actual monkey to eat it) was enough to induce resentment in a female capuchin.
The researchers suggest that capuchin monkeys, like humans, are guided by social emotions. In the wild, they are a co-operative, group-living species. Such co-operation is likely to be stable only when each animal feels it is not being cheated. Feelings of righteous indignation, it seems, are not the preserve of people alone. Refusing a lesser reward completely makes these feelings abundantly clear to other members of the group. However, whether such a sense of fairness evolved independently in capuchins and humans, or whether it stems from the common ancestor that the species had 35 million years ago, is, as yet, an unanswered question.
21.	In the opening paragraph, the author introduces his topic by ________.
[A] posing a contrast
[B] justifying an assumption
[C] making a comparison
[D] explaining a phenomenon
22.	The statement “it is all too monkey” (Last line, Paragraph l) implies that ________.
[A] monkeys are also outraged by slack rivals
[B] resenting unfairness is also monkeys’ nature
[C] monkeys, like humans, tend to be jealous of each other
[D] no animals other than monkeys can develop such emotions
23.	Female capuchin monkeys were chosen for the research most probably because they are ________.
[A] more inclined to weigh what they get
[B] attentive to researchers’ instructions
[C] nice in both appearance and temperament
[D] more generous than their male companions
24.	Dr. Brosnan and Dr. de Waal have eventually found in their study that the monkeys ________.
[A] prefer grapes to cucumbers
[B] can be taught to exchange things
[C] will not be co-operative if feeling cheated
[D] are unhappy when separated from others
25.	What can we infer from the last paragraph?
[A] Monkeys can be trained to develop social emotions.
[B] Human indignation evolved from an uncertain source.
[C] Animals usually show their feelings openly as humans do.
[D] Cooperation among monkeys remains stable only in the wild.

Do you remember all those years when scientists argued that smoking would kill us but the doubters insisted that we didn’t know for sure? That the evidence was inconclusive, the science uncertain? That the antismoking lobby was out to destroy our way of life and the government should stay out of the way? Lots of Americans bought that nonsense, and over three decades, some 10 million smokers went to early graves.
There are upsetting parallels today, as scientists in one wave after another try to awaken us to the growing threat of global warming. The latest was a panel from the National Academy of Sciences, enlisted by the White House, to tell us that the Earth’s atmosphere is definitely warming and that the problem is largely man-made. The clear message is that we should get moving to protect ourselves. The president of the National Academy, Bruce Alberts, added this key point in the preface to the panel’s report: “Science never has all the answers. But science does provide us with the best available guide to the future, and it is critical that our nation and the world base important policies on the best judgments that science can provide concerning the future consequences of present actions.”
Just as on smoking, voices now come from many quarters insisting that the science about global warming is incomplete, that it’s OK to keep pouring fumes into the air until we know for sure. This is a dangerous game: by the time 100 percent of the evidence is in, it may be too late. With the risks obvious and growing, a prudent people would take out an insurance policy now.
Fortunately, the White House is starting to pay attention. But it’s obvious that a majority of the president’s advisers still don’t take global warming seriously. Instead of a plan of action, they continue to press for more research -- a classic case of “paralysis by analysis.”
To serve as responsible stewards of the planet, we must press forward on deeper atmospheric and oceanic research. But research alone is inadequate. If the Administration won’t take the legislative initiative, Congress should help to begin fashioning conservation measures. A bill by Democratic Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, which would offer financial incentives for private industry, is a promising start. Many see that the country is getting ready to build lots of new power plants to meet our energy needs. If we are ever going to protect the atmosphere, it is crucial that those new plants be environmentally sound.
26.	An argument made by supporters of smoking was that ________.
[A] there was no scientific evidence of the correlation between smoking and death
[B] the number of early deaths of smokers in the past decades was insignificant
[C] people had the freedom to choose their own way of life
[D] antismoking people were usually talking nonsense
27.	According to Bruce Alberts, science can serve as ________.
[A] a protector
[B] a judge
[C] a critic
[D] a guide
28.	What does the author mean by “paralysis by analysis” (Last line, Paragraph 4)?
[A] Endless studies kill action.
[B] Careful investigation reveals truth.
[C] Prudent planning hinders progress.
[D] Extensive research helps decision-making.
29.	According to the author, what should the Administration do about global warming?
[A] Offer aid to build cleaner power plants.
[B] Raise public awareness of conservation.
[C] Press for further scientific research.
[D] Take some legislative measures.
30.	The author associates the issue of global warming with that of smoking because ________.
[A] they both suffered from the government’s negligence
[B] a lesson from the latter is applicable to the former
[C] the outcome of the latter aggravates the former
[D] both of them have turned from bad to worse
Text 3
Of all the components of a good night’s sleep, dreams seem to be least within our control. In dreams, a window opens into a world where logic is suspended and dead people speak. A century ago, Freud formulated his revolutionary theory that dreams were the disguised shadows of our unconscious desires and fears; by the late 1970s, neurologists had switched to thinking of them as just “mental noise” -- the random byproducts of the neural-repair work that goes on during sleep. Now researchers suspect that dreams are part of the mind’s emotional thermostat, regulating moods while the brain is “off-line.” And one leading authority says that these intensely powerful mental events can be not only harnessed but actually brought under conscious control, to help us sleep and feel better, “It’s your dream,” says Rosalind Cartwright, chair of psychology at Chicago’s Medical Center. “If you don’t like it, change it.”
Evidence from brain imaging supports this view. The brain is as active during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep -- when most vivid dreams occur -- as it is when fully awake, says Dr, Eric Nofzinger at the University of Pittsburgh. But not all parts of the brain are equally involved; the limbic system (the “emotional brain”) is especially active, while the prefrontal cortex (the center of intellect and reasoning) is relatively quiet. “We wake up from dreams happy or depressed, and those feelings can stay with us all day.” says Stanford sleep researcher Dr. William Dement.
The link between dreams and emotions shows up among the patients in Cartwright’s clinic. Most people seem to have more bad dreams early in the night, progressing toward happier ones before awakening, suggesting that they are working through negative feelings generated during the day. Because our conscious mind is occupied with daily life we don’t always think about the emotional significance of the day’s events -- until, it appears, we begin to dream.
And this process need not be left to the unconscious. Cartwright believes one can exercise conscious control over recurring bad dreams. As soon as you awaken, identify what is upsetting about the dream. Visualize how you would like it to end instead; the next time it occurs, try to wake up just enough to control its course. With much practice people can learn to, literally, do it in their sleep.
At the end of the day, there’s probably little reason to pay attention to our dreams at all unless they keep us from sleeping or “we wake up in a panic,” Cartwright says. Terrorism, economic uncertainties and general feelings of insecurity have increased people’s anxiety. Those suffering from persistent nightmares should seek help from a therapist. For the rest of us, the brain has its ways of working through bad feelings. Sleep -- or rather dream -- on it and you’ll feel better in the morning.
31.	Researchers have come to believe that dreams ________.
[A] can be modified in their courses
[B] are susceptible to emotional changes
[C] reflect our innermost desires and fears
[D] are a random outcome of neural repairs
32.	By referring to the limbic system, the author intends to show ________.
[A] its function in our dreams
[B] the mechanism of REM sleep
[C] the relation of dreams to emotions
[D] its difference from the prefrontal cortex
33.	The negative feelings generated during the day tend to ________.
[A] aggravate in our unconscious mind
[B] develop into happy dreams
[C] persist till the time we fall asleep
[D] show up in dreams early at night
34.	Cartwright seems to suggest that ________.
[A] waking up in time is essential to the ridding of bad dreams
[B] visualizing bad dreams helps bring them under control
[C] dreams should be left to their natural progression
[D] dreaming may not entirely belong to the unconscious
35.	What advice might Cartwright give to those who sometimes have bad dreams?
[A] Lead your life as usual.
[B] Seek professional help.
[C] Exercise conscious control.
[D] Avoid anxiety in the daytime.
Text 4
Americans no longer expect public figures, whether in speech or in writing, to command the English language with skill and gift. Nor do they aspire to such command themselves. In his latest book, Doing Our Own Thing: The Degradation of Language and Music and Why We Should, Like, Care, John McWhorter, a linguist and controversialist of mixed liberal and conservative views, sees the triumph of 1960s counter-culture as responsible for the decline of formal English.
Blaming the permissive 1960s is nothing new, but this is not yet another criticism against the decline in education. Mr. McWhorter’s academic speciality is language history and change, and he sees the gradual disappearance of “whom,” for example, to be natural and no more regrettable than the loss of the case-endings of Old English.
But the cult of the authentic and the personal, “doing our own thing,” has spelt the death of formal speech, writing, poetry and music. While even the modestly educated sought an elevated tone when they put pen to paper before the 1960s, even the most well regarded writing since then has sought to capture spoken English on the page. Equally, in poetry, the highly personal, performative genre is the only form that could claim real liveliness. In both oral and written English, talking is triumphing over speaking, spontaneity over craft.
Illustrated with an entertaining array of examples from both high and low culture, the trend that Mr. McWhorter documents is unmistakable. But it is less clear, to take the question of his subtitle, why we should, like, care. As a linguist, he acknowledges that all varieties of human language, including non-standard ones like Black English, can be powerfully expressive -- there exists no language or dialect in the world that cannot convey complex ideas. He is not arguing, as many do, that we can no longer think straight because we do not talk proper.
Russians have a deep love for their own language and carry large chunks of memorized poetry in their heads, while Italian politicians tend to elaborate speech that would seem old-fashioned to most English-speakers. Mr. McWhorter acknowledges that formal language is not strictly necessary, and proposes no radical education reforms -- he is really grieving over the loss of something beautiful more than useful. We now take our English “on paper plates instead of china.” A shame, perhaps, but probably an inevitable one.
36.	According to McWhorter, the decline of formal English ________.
[A] is inevitable in radical education reforms
[B] is but all too natural in language development
[C] has caused the controversy over the counter-culture
[D] brought about changes in public attitudes in the 1960s
37.	The word “talking” (Line 6, Paragraph 3) denotes ________.
[A] modesty
[B] personality
[C] liveliness
[D] informality
38.	To which of the following statements would McWhorter most likely agree?
[A] Logical thinking is not necessarily related to the way we talk.
[B] Black English can be more expressive than standard English.
[C] Non-standard varieties of human language are just as entertaining.
[D] Of all the varieties, standard English can best convey complex ideas.
39.	The description of Russians’ love of memorizing poetry shows the author’s ________.
[A] interest in their language
[B] appreciation of their efforts
[C] admiration for their memory
[D] contempt for their old-fashionedness
40.	According to the last paragraph, “paper plates” is to “china” as ________.
[A] “temporary” is to “permanent”
[B] “radical” is to “conservative”
[C] “functional” is to “artistic”

Canada’s premiers (the leaders of provincial governments), if they have any breath left after complaining about Ottawa at their late July annual meeting, might spare a moment to do something, together, to reduce health-care costs.
They’re all groaning about soaring health budgets, the fastest-growing component of which are pharmaceutical costs.
41.	________
What to do? Both the Romanow commission and the Kirby committee on health care -- to say nothing of reports from other experts -- recommended the creation of a national drug agency. Instead of each province having its own list of approved drugs, bureaucracy, procedures and limited bargaining power, all would pool resources, work with Ottawa, and create a national institution.
42.	________
But “national” doesn’t have to mean that. “National” could mean interprovincial -- provinces combining efforts to create one body.
Either way, one benefit of a “national” organization would be to negotiate better prices, if possible, with drug manufacturers. Instead of having one province -- or a series of hospitals within a province -- negotiate a price for a given drug on the provincial list, the national agency would negotiate on behalf of all provinces.
Rather than, say, Quebec, negotiating on behalf of seven million people, the national agency would negotiate on behalf of 31 million people. Basic economics suggests the greater the potential consumers, the higher the likelihood of a better price.
43.	________
A small step has been taken in the direction of a national agency with the creation of the Canadian Co-ordinating Office for Health Technology Assessment, funded by Ottawa and the provinces. Under it, a Common Drug Review recommends to provincial lists which new drugs should be included. Predictably, and regrettably, Quebec refused to join.
A few premiers are suspicious of any federal-provincial deal-making. They (particularly Quebec and Alberta) just want Ottawa to fork over additional billions with few, if any, strings attached. That’s one reason why the idea of a national list hasn’t gone anywhere, while drug costs keep rising fast.
44.	________
Premiers love to quote Mr. Romanow’s report selectively, especially the parts about more federal money. Perhaps they should read what he had to say about drugs: “A national drug agency would provide governments more influence on pharmaceutical companies in order to constrain the ever-increasing cost of drugs.”
45.	________
So when the premiers gather in Niagara Falls to assemble their usual complaint list, they should also get cracking about something in their jurisdiction that would help their budgets and patients.
[A] Quebec’s resistance to a national agency is provincialist ideology. One of the first advocates for a national list was a researcher at Laval University. Quebec’s Drug Insurance Fund has seen its costs skyrocket with annual increases from 14.3 per cent to 26.8 per cent!
[B] Or they could read Mr. Kirby’s report: “the substantial buying power of such an agency would strengthen the public prescription-drug insurance plans to negotiate the lowest possible purchase prices from drug companies.”
[C] What does “national” mean? Roy Romanow and Senator Michael Kirby recommended a federal-provincial body much like the recently created National Health Council.
[D] The problem is simple and stark: health-care costs have been, are, and will continue to increase faster than government revenues.
[E] According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information, prescription drug costs have risen since 1997 at twice the rate of overall health-care spending. Part of the increase comes from drugs being used to replace other kinds of treatments. Part of it arises from new drugs costing more than older kinds. Part of it is higher prices.
[F] So, if the provinces want to run the health-care show, they should prove they can run it, starting with an interprovincial health list that would end duplication, save administrative costs, prevent one province from being played off against another, and bargain for better drug prices.
[G] Of course, the pharmaceutical companies will scream. They like divided buyers; they can lobby better that way. They can use the threat of removing jobs from one province to another. They can hope that, if one province includes a drug on its list, the pressure will cause others to include it on theirs. They wouldn’t like a national agency, but self-interest would lead them to deal with it.

It is not easy to talk about the role of the mass media in this overwhelmingly significant phase in European history. History and news become confused, and one’s impressions tend to be a mixture of skepticism and optimism. 46) Television is one of the means by which these feelings are created and conveyed -- and perhaps never before has it served so much to connect different peoples and nations as in the recent events in Europe. The Europe that is now forming cannot be anything other than its peoples, their cultures and national identities. With this in mind we can begin to analyze the European television scene. 47) In Europe, as elsewhere, multi-media groups have been increasingly successful: groups which bring together television, radio, newspapers, magazines and publishing houses that work in relation to one another. One Italian example would be the Berlusconi group, while abroad Maxwell and Murdoch come to mind.
Clearly, only the biggest and most flexible television companies are going to be able to compete in such a rich and hotly-contested market. 48) This alone demonstrates that the television business is not an easy world to survive in, a fact underlined by statistics that show that out of eighty European television networks, no less than 50% took a loss in 1989.
Moreover, the integration of the European community will oblige television companies to cooperate more closely in terms of both production and distribution.
49) Creating a “European identity” that respects the different cultures and traditions which go to make up the connecting fabric of the Old Continent is no easy task and demands a strategic choice -- that of producing programs in Europe for Europe. This entails reducing our dependence on the North American market, whose programs relate to experiences and cultural traditions which are different from our own.
In order to achieve these objectives, we must concentrate more on co-productions, the exchange of news, documentary services and training. This also involves the agreements between European countries for the creation of a European bank for Television Production which, on the model of the European Investments Bank, will handle the finances necessary for production costs. 50) In dealing with a challenge on such a scale, it is no exaggeration to say “United we stand, divided we fall” -- and if I had to choose a slogan it would be “Unity in our diversity.” A unity of objectives that nonetheless respect the varied peculiarities of each country.

A Helpless Father
The picture ironically shows that a pitiable old man in rags is being helplessly kicked off by his three sons and a daughter, who all wear decent clothes. The father’s negligent children are all guarding their home gates lest their old father “roll into” their households. In other words, they four ignore their moral sense of assuming the responsibility for their old father even though they may be all living a satisfying life. That is a painful scene we often encounter in our daily life.
Sad to say, the moral decline of the younger generations may be a rather explosive situation in our modern society. People definitely have their living conditions improved by wider and wider margins, as evidenced by the four children’s decent dressing, but their moral sense still remains sadly unchanged or in some cases becomes dramatically downgrading. Most people might have become too much self-centered, and even worse, they discard the tradition of giving respect to the elderly. They no longer care for their elders, let alone their neighbors or the disadvantaged; instead they try every means to avoid responsibility for other citizens. When one cares for others, one might even appear stupid or may even be distrusted.
Therefore, we have to take some useful measures to avoid the scene that is mentioned above. We must launch a variety of campaigns about the return to the good tradition of giving help and love to the elderly. Moreover, we must appeal to our government to establish some relevant laws to punish those who avoid their duties. The last but not the least, our respect for age is an indication of the progress of human society, as imperatives of traditions require. We sincerely wish that the old man could be welcome to any of the four households, elegantly dressed, and a smile on the face.

Text 1
In spite of “endless talk of difference,” American society is an amazing machine for homogenizing people. There is “the democratizing uniformity of dress and discourse, and the casualness and absence of deference” characteristic of popular culture. People are absorbed into “a culture of consumption” launched by the 19th-century department stores that offered “vast arrays of goods in an elegant atmosphere. Instead of intimate shops catering to a knowledgeable elite,” these were stores “anyone could enter, regardless of class or background. This turned shopping into a public and democratic act.” The mass media, advertising and sports are other forces for homogenization.
Immigrants are quickly fitting into this common culture, which may not be altogether elevating but is hardly poisonous. Writing for the National Immigration Forum, Gregory Rodriguez reports that today’s immigration is neither at unprecedented levels nor resistant to assimilation. In 1998 immigrants were 9.8 percent of population; in 1900, 13.6 percent. In the 10 years prior to 1990, 3.1 immigrants arrived for every 1,000 residents; in the 10 years prior to 1890, 9.2 for every 1,000. Now, consider three indices of assimilation -- language, home ownership and intermarriage.
The 1990 Census revealed that “a majority of immigrants from each of the fifteen most common countries of origin spoke English ‘well’ or ‘very well’ after ten years of residence.” The children of immigrants tend to be bilingual and proficient in English. “By the third generation, the original language is lost in the majority of immigrant families.” Hence the description of America as a “graveyard” for languages. By 1996 foreign-born immigrants who had arrived before 1970 had a home ownership rate of 75.6 percent, higher than the 69.8 percent rate among native-born Americans.
Foreign-born Asians and Hispanics “have higher rates of intermarriage than do U.S.-born whites and blacks.” By the third generation, one third of Hispanic women are married to non-Hispanics, and 41 percent of Asian-American women are married to non-Asians.
Rodriguez notes that children in remote villages around the world are fans of superstars like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks, yet “some Americans fear that immigrants living within the United States remain somehow immune to the nation’s assimilative power.”
Are there divisive issues and pockets of seething anger in America? Indeed. It is big enough to have a bit of everything. But particularly when viewed against America’s turbulent past, today’s social indices hardly suggest a dark and deteriorating social environment.
21.	The word “homogenizing” (Line 2, Paragraph 1) most probably means ________.
[A] identifying
[B] associating
[C] assimilating
[D] monopolizing
22.	According to the author, the department stores of the 19th century ________.
[A] played a role in the spread of popular culture
[B] became intimate shops for common consumers
[C] satisfied the needs of a knowledgeable elite
[D] owed its emergence to the culture of consumption
23.	The text suggests that immigrants now in the U.S. ________.
[A] are resistant to homogenization
[B] exert a great influence on American culture
[C] are hardly a threat to the common culture
[D] constitute the majority of the population
24.	Why are Arnold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks mentioned in Paragraph 5?
[A] To prove their popularity around the world.
[B] To reveal the public’s fear of immigrants.
[C] To give examples of successful immigrants.
[D] To show the powerful influence of American culture.
25.	In the author’s opinion, the absorption of immigrants into American society is ________.
[A] rewarding
[B] successful
[C] fruitless
[D] harmful
Text 2
Stratford-on-Avon, as we all know, has only one industry -- William Shakespeare -- but there are two distinctly separate and increasingly hostile branches. There is the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), which presents superb productions of the plays at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre on the Avon. And there are the townsfolk who largely live off the tourists who come, not to see the plays, but to look at Anne Hathaway’s Cottage, Shakespeare’s birthplace and the other sights.
The worthy residents of Stratford doubt that the theatre adds a penny to their revenue. They frankly dislike the RSC’s actors, them with their long hair and beards and sandals and noisiness. It’s all deliciously ironic when you consider that Shakespeare, who earns their living, was himself an actor (with a beard) and did his share of noise-making.
The tourist streams are not entirely separate. The sightseers who come by bus -- and often take in Warwick Castle and Blenheim Palace on the side -- don’t usually see the plays, and some of them are even surprised to find a theatre in Stratford. However, the playgoers do manage a little sight-seeing along with their playgoing. It is the playgoers, the RSC contends, who bring in much of the town’s revenue because they spend the night (some of them four or five nights) pouring cash into the hotels and restaurants. The sightseers can take in everything and get out of town by nightfall.
The townsfolk don’t see it this way and local council does not contribute directly to the subsidy of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Stratford cries poor traditionally. Nevertheless every hotel in town seems to be adding a new wing or cocktail lounge. Hilton is building its own hotel there, which you may be sure will be decorated with Hamlet Hamburger Bars, the Lear Lounge, the Banquo Banqueting Room, and so forth, and will be very expensive.
Anyway, the townsfolk can’t understand why the Royal Shakespeare Company needs a subsidy. (The theatre has broken attendance records for three years in a row. Last year its 1,431 seats were 94 percent occupied all year long and this year they’ll do better.) The reason, of course, is that costs have rocketed and ticket prices have stayed low.
It would be a shame to raise prices too much because it would drive away the young people who are Stratford’s most attractive clientele. They come entirely for the plays, not the sights. They all seem to look alike (though they come from all over) -- lean, pointed, dedicated faces, wearing jeans and sandals, eating their buns and bedding down for the night on the flagstones outside the theatre to buy the 20 seats and 80 standing-room tickets held for the sleepers and sold to them when the box office opens at 10:30 a.m.
26.	From the first two paragraphs, we learn that ________.
[A] the townsfolk deny the RSC’s contribution to the town’s revenue
[B] the actors of the RSC imitate Shakespeare on and off stage
[C] the two branches of the RSC are not on good terms
[D] the townsfolk earn little from tourism
27.	It can be inferred from Paragraph 3 that ________.
[A] the sightseers cannot visit the Castle and the Palace separately
[B] the playgoers spend more money than the sightseers
[C] the sightseers do more shopping than the playgoers
[D] the playgoers go to no other places in town than the theater
28.	By saying “Stratford cries poor traditionally” (Line 2-3, Paragraph 4), the author implies that ________.
[A] Stratford cannot afford the expansion projects
[B] Stratford has long been in financial difficulties
[C] the town is not really short of money
[D] the townsfolk used to be poorly paid
29.	According to the townsfolk, the RSC deserves no subsidy because ________.
[A] ticket prices can be raised to cover the spending
[B] the company is financially ill-managed
[C] the behavior of the actors is not socially acceptable
[D] the theatre attendance is on the rise
30.	From the text we can conclude that the author ________.
[A] is supportive of both sides
[B] favors the townsfolk’s view
[C] takes a detached attitude
[D] is sympathetic to the RSC
Text 3
When prehistoric man arrived in new parts of the world, something strange happened to the large animals. They suddenly became extinct. Smaller species survived. The large, slow-growing animals were easy game, and were quickly hunted to extinction. Now something similar could be happening in the oceans.
That the seas are being overfished has been known for years. What researchers such as Ransom Myers and Boris Worm have shown is just how fast things are changing. They have looked at half a century of data from fisheries around the world. Their methods do not attempt to estimate the actual biomass (the amount of living biological matter) of fish species in particular parts of the ocean, but rather changes in that biomass over time. According to their latest paper published in Nature, the biomass of large predators (animals that kill and eat other animals) in a new fishery is reduced on average by 80% within 15 years of the start of exploitation. In some long-fished areas, it has halved again since then.
Dr. Worm acknowledges that these figures are conservative. One reason for this is that fishing technology has improved. Today’s vessels can find their prey using satellites and sonar, which were not available 50 years ago. That means a higher proportion of what is in the sea is being caught, so the real difference between present and past is likely to be worse than the one recorded by changes in catch sizes. In the early days, too, longlines would have been more saturated with fish. Some individuals would therefore not have been caught, since no baited hooks would have been available to trap them, leading to an underestimate of fish stocks in the past. Furthermore, in the early days of longline fishing, a lot of fish were lost to sharks after they had been hooked. That is no longer a problem, because there are fewer sharks around now.
Dr. Myers and Dr. Worm argue that their work gives a correct baseline, which future management efforts must take into account. They believe the data support an idea current among marine biologists, that of the “shifting baseline.” The notion is that people have failed to detect the massive changes which have happened in the ocean because they have been looking back only a relatively short time into the past. That matters because theory suggests that the maximum sustainable yield that can be cropped from a fishery comes when the biomass of a target species is about 50% of its original levels. Most fisheries are well below that, which is a bad way to do business.
31.	The extinction of large prehistoric animals is noted to suggest that ________.
[A] large animal were vulnerable to the changing environment
[B] small species survived as large animals disappeared
[C] large sea animals may face the same threat today
[D] slow-growing fish outlive fast-growing ones
32.	We can infer from Dr. Myers and Dr. Worm’s paper that ________.
[A] the stock of large predators in some old fisheries has reduced by 90%
[B] there are only half as many fisheries as there were 15 years ago
[C] the catch sizes in new fisheries are only 20% of the original amount
[D] the number of larger predators dropped faster in new fisheries than in the old
33.	By saying "these figures are conservative" (Line 1, paragraph 3), Dr. Worm means that ________.
[A] fishing technology has improved rapidly
[B] the catch-sizes are actually smaller than recorded
[C] the marine biomass has suffered a greater loss
[D] the data collected so far are out of date
34.	Dr. Myers and other researchers hold that ________.
[A] people should look for a baseline that can work for a longer time
[B] fisheries should keep their yields below 50% of the biomass
[C] the ocean biomass should be restored to its original level
[D] people should adjust the fishing baseline to the changing situation
35.	The author seems to be mainly concerned with most fisheries’ ________.
[A] management efficiency
[B] biomass level
[C] catch-size limits
[D] technological application
Text 4
Many things make people think artists are weird. But the weirdest may be this: artists’ only job is to explore emotions, and yet they choose to focus on the ones that feel bad.
This wasn’t always so. The earliest forms of art, like painting and music, are those best suited for expressing joy. But somewhere from the 19th century onward, more artists began seeing happiness as meaningless, phony or, worst of all, boring, as we went from Wordsworth’s daffodils to Baudelaire’s flowers of evil.
You could argue that art became more skeptical of happiness because modern times have seen so much misery. But it’s not as if earlier times didn’t know perpetual war, disaster and the massacre of innocents. The reason, in fact, may be just the opposite: there is too much damn happiness in the world today.
After all, what is the one modern form of expression almost completely dedicated to depicting happiness? Advertising. The rise of anti-happy art almost exactly tracks the emergence of mass media, and with it, a commercial culture in which happiness is not just an ideal but an ideology.
People in earlier eras were surrounded by reminders of misery. They worked until exhausted, lived with few protections and died young. In the West, before mass communication and literacy, the most powerful mass medium was the church, which reminded worshippers that their souls were in danger and that they would someday be meat for worms. Given all this, they did not exactly need their art to be a bummer too.
Today the messages the average Westerner is surrounded with are not religious but commercial, and forever happy. Fast-food eaters, news anchors, text messengers, all smiling, smiling, smiling. Our magazines feature beaming celebrities and happy families in perfect homes. And since these messages have an agenda -- to lure us to open our wallets -- they make the very idea of happiness seem unreliable. “Celebrate!” commanded the ads for the arthritis drug Celebrex, before we found out it could increase the risk of heart attacks.
But what we forget -- what our economy depends on us forgetting -- is that happiness is more than pleasure without pain. The things that bring the greatest joy carry the greatest potential for loss and disappointment. Today, surrounded by promises of easy happiness, we need art to tell us, as religion once did, Memento mori: remember that you will die, that everything ends, and that happiness comes not in denying this but in living with it. It’s a message even more bitter than a clove cigarette, yet, somehow, a breath of fresh air.
36.	By citing the examples of poets Wordsworth and Baudelaire, the author intends to show that ________.
[A] poetry is not as expressive of joy as painting or music
[B] art grows out of both positive and negative feelings
[C] poets today are less skeptical of happiness
[D] artists have changed their focus of interest
37.	The word “bummer” (Line 5, paragraph 5) most probably means something ________.
[A] religious
[B] unpleasant
[C] entertaining
[D] commercial
38.	In the author’s opinion, advertising ________.
[A] emerges in the wake of the anti-happy art
[B] is a cause of disappointment for the general public
[C] replaces the church as a major source of information
[D] creates an illusion of happiness rather than happiness itself
39.	We can learn from the last paragraph that the author believes ________.
[A] happiness more often than not ends in sadness
[B] the anti-happy art is distasteful but refreshing
[C] misery should be enjoyed rather than denied
[D] the anti-happy art flourishes when economy booms
40.	Which of the following is true of the text?
[A] Religion once functioned as a reminder of misery.
[B] Art provides a balance between expectation and reality.
[C] People feel disappointed at the realities of modern society.
[D] Mass media are inclined to cover disasters and deaths.

On the north bank of the Ohio river sits Evansville, Ind., home of David Williams, 52, and of a riverboat casino (a place where gambling games are played). During several years of gambling in that casino, Williams, a state auditor earning $35,000 a year, lost approximately $175,000. He had never gambled before the casino sent him a coupon for $20 worth of gambling.
He visited the casino, lost the $20 and left. On his second visit he lost $800. The casino issued to him, as a good customer, a "Fun Card", which when used in the casino earns points for meals and drinks, and enables the casino to track the user’s gambling activities. For Williams, those activities become what he calls "electronic heroin".
(41) ________. In 1997 he lost $21,000 to one slot machine in two days. In March 1997 he lost $72,186. He sometimes played two slot machines at a time, all night, until the boat docked at 5 a.m., then went back aboard when the casino opened at 9 a.m. Now he is suing the casino, charging that it should have refused his patronage because it knew he was addicted. It did know he had a problem.
In March 1998 a friend of Williams’s got him involuntarily confined to a treatment center for addictions, and wrote to inform the casino of Williams’s gambling problem. The casino included a photo of Williams among those of banned gamblers, and wrote to him a “cease admissions” letter. Noting the medical/psychological nature of problem gambling behavior, the letter said that before being readmitted to the casino he would have to present medical/psychological information demonstrating that patronizing the casino would pose no threat to his safety or well-being.
(42) ________.
The Wall Street Journal reports that the casino has 24 signs warning: “Enjoy the fun... and always bet with your head, not over it.” Every entrance ticket lists a toll-free number for counseling from the Indiana Department of Mental Health. Nevertheless, Williams’s suit charges that the casino, knowing he was “helplessly addicted to gambling,” intentionally worked to “lure” him to “engage in conduct against his will.” Well.
(43) ________.
The fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders says “pathological gambling” involves persistent, recurring and uncontrollable pursuit less of money than of thrill of taking risks in quest of a windfall.
(44) ________. Pushed by science, or what claims to be science, society is reclassifying what once were considered character flaws or moral failings as personality disorders akin to physical disabilities.
(45) ________.
Forty-four states have lotteries, 29 have casinos, and most of these states are to varying degrees dependent on -- you might say addicted to -- revenues from wagering. And since the first Internet gambling site was created in 1995, competition for gamblers’ dollars has become intense. The Oct. 28 issue of Newsweek reported that 2 million gamblers patronize 1,800 virtual casinos every week. With $3.5 billion being lost on Internet wagers this year, gambling has passed pornography as the Web’s most profitable business.
[A]	Although no such evidence was presented, the casino’s marketing department continued to pepper him with mailings. And he entered the casino and used his Fun Card without being detected.
[B]	It is unclear what luring was required, given his compulsive behavior. And in what sense was his will operative?
[C]	By the time he had lost $5,000 he said to himself that if he could get back to even, he would quit. One night he won $5,500, but he did not quit.
[D]	Gambling has been a common feature of American life forever, but for a long time it was broadly considered a sin, or a social disease. Now it is a social policy: the most important and aggressive promoter of gambling in America is the government.
[E]	David Williams’s suit should trouble this gambling nation. But don’t bet on it.
[F]	It is worrisome that society is medicalizing more and more behavioral problems, often defining as addictions what earlier, sterner generations explained as weakness of will.
[G]	The anonymous, lonely, undistracted nature of online gambling is especially conducive to compulsive behavior. But even if the government knew how to move against Internet gambling, what would be its grounds for doing so?

Is it true that the American intellectual is rejected and considered of no account in his society? I am going to suggest that it is not true. Father Bruckberger told part of the story when he observed that it is the intellectuals who have rejected America. But they have done more than that. They have grown dissatisfied with the role of intellectual. It is they, not America, who have become anti-intellectual.
First, the object of our study pleads for definition. What is an intellectual? 46) I shall define him as an individual who has elected as his primary duty and pleasure in life the activity of thinking in a Socratic (苏格拉底) way about moral problems. He explores such problems consciously, articulately, and frankly, first by asking factual questions, then by asking moral questions, finally by suggesting action which seems appropriate in the light of the factual and moral information which he has obtained. 47) His function is analogous to that of a judge, who must accept the obligation of revealing in as obvious a manner as possible the course of reasoning which led him to his decision.
This definition excludes many individuals usually referred to as intellectuals -- the average scientist, for one. 48) I have excluded him because, while his accomplishments may contribute to the solution of moral problems, he has not been charged with the task of approaching any but the factual aspects of those problems. Like other human beings, he encounters moral issues even in the everyday performance of his routine duties -- he is not supposed to cook his experiments, manufacture evidence, or doctor his reports. 49) But his primary task is not to think about the moral code which governs his activity, any more than a businessman is expected to dedicate his energies to an exploration of rules of conduct in business. During most of his waking life he will take his code for granted, as the businessman takes his ethics.
The definition also excludes the majority of teachers, despite the fact that teaching has traditionally been the method whereby many intellectuals earn their living. 50) They may teach very well and more than earn their salaries, but most of them make little or no independent reflections on human problems which involve moral judgment. This description even fits the majority of eminent scholars. Being learned in some branch of human knowledge is one thing, living in "public and illustrious thoughts,” as Emerson would say, is something else.

Dear Sir or Madam,
As a college student who is studying and living in a good environment, I wish to contribute to Project Hope by offering financial assistance to a child in a remote area. Having conceived such a plan for a long time, I write this letter to request your help to recommend a proper candidate.
I wonder if it is convenient for you if three things concerning the child are taken into consideration. First, the child should come from Gansu Province, for I intend to help a child from my hometown. Second, it will be better if the child is a primary school student. I hope I will help him/her from the very beginning. In addition, he/she must be willing to return to his hometown to help built it after graduation from university.
My plan will be carried out as follows. On one hand, I will remit at least 2,000 Yuan in cash every year until he/she finishes his/her education before entering college. On the other hand, I decide to teach the child math and English in person during my summer vacation, which will surely be more beneficial to the child.
Your prompt help would be highly appreciated. And I am looking forward to your reply very soon.
Yours sincerely,
Li Ming

How ironic the two pictures are in describing one of the most widespread social phenomena concerning idol adoration! In the first picture, a young man writes the name of Beckham on his face. In the second picture, another young man spends 300 Yuan in dealing with his hair to make himself look like Beckham.
The meaning conveyed in the two pictures reveals that in current China some young people are losing themselves. I am greatly shocked by the enthusiasm for this British football superstar shown by these two young men. Frankly speaking, things of this kind really happen among us. Some people, especially college students, do nothing but concentrate on imitating superstars. This does great harm to their study and growth. If we can’t stop the worsening of this tendency, our own culture will be damaged, and we ourselves will be the ultimate victims.
From my point of view, a lot of measures should be taken to save our losing culture and re-find ourselves. In fact, some measures have already been taken. In my university, campaigns have been launched to educate people to pay more attention to our traditional culture and read more books instead of focusing on our appearances. As a result, we have witnessed some improvements but still there is a long way to go.

If you were to examine the birth certificates of every soccer player in 2006’s World Cup tournament, you would most likely find a noteworthy quirk: elite soccer players are more likely to have been born in the earlier months of the year than in the later months. If you then examined the European national youth teams that feed the World Cup and professional ranks, you would find this strange phenomenon to be even more pronounced.
What might account for this strange phenomenon? Here are a few guesses: a) certain astrological signs confer superior soccer skills; b) winter-born babies tend to have higher oxygen capacity, which increases soccer stamina; c) soccer-mad parents are more likely to conceive children in springtime, at the annual peak of soccer mania; d) none of the above.
Anders Ericsson, a 58-year-old psychology professor at Florida State University, says he believes strongly in “none of the above.” Ericsson grew up in Sweden, and studied nuclear engineering until he realized he would have more opportunity to conduct his own research if he switched to psychology. His first experiment, nearly 30 years ago, involved memory: training a person to hear and then repeat a random series of numbers. “With the first subject, after about 20 hours of training, his digit span had risen from 7 to 20,” Ericsson recalls. “He kept improving, and after about 200 hours of training he had risen to over 80 numbers.”
This success, coupled with later research showing that memory itself is not genetically determined, led Ericsson to conclude that the act of memorizing is more of a cognitive exercise than an intuitive one. In other words, whatever inborn differences two people may exhibit in their abilities to memorize, those differences are swamped by how well each person “encodes” the information. And the best way to learn how to encode information meaningfully, Ericsson determined, was a process known as deliberate practice. Deliberate practice entails more than simply repeating a task. Rather, it involves setting specific goals, obtaining immediate feedback and concentrating as much on technique as on outcome.
Ericsson and his colleagues have thus taken to studying expert performers in a wide range of pursuits, including soccer. They gather all the data they can, not just performance statistics and biographical details but also the results of their own laboratory experiments with high achievers. Their work makes a rather startling assertion: the trait we commonly call talent is highly overrated. Or, put another way, expert performers C whether in memory or surgery, ballet or computer programming C are nearly always made, not born.
21.	The birthday phenomenon found among soccer players is mentioned to
[A] stress the importance of professional training.
[B] spotlight the soccer superstars in the World Cup.
[C] introduce the topic of what makes expert performance.
[D] explain why some soccer teams play better than others.
22.	The word “mania” (Line 4, Paragraph 2) most probably means
[A] fun.
[B] craze.
[C] hysteria.
[D] excitement.
23.	According to Ericsson, good memory
[A] depends on meaningful processing of information.
[B] results from intuitive rather than cognitive exercises.
[C] is determined by genetic rather than psychological factors.
[D] requires immediate feedback and a high degree of concentration.
24.	Ericsson and his colleagues believe that
[A] talent is a dominating factor for professional success.
[B] biographical data provide the key to excellent performance.
[C] the role of talent tends to be overlooked.
[D] high achievers owe their success mostly to nurture.
25.	Which of the following proverbs is closest to the message the text tries to convey?
[A] “Faith will move mountains.”
[B] “One reaps what one sows.”
[C] “Practice makes perfect.”
[D] “Like father, like son.”
Text 2
For the past several years, the Sunday newspaper supplement Parade has featured a column called “Ask Marilyn.” People are invited to query Marilyn vos Savant, who at age 10 had tested at a mental level of someone about 23 years old; that gave her an IQ of 228 C the highest score ever recorded. IQ tests ask you to complete verbal and visual analogies, to envision paper after it has been folded and cut, and to deduce numerical sequences, among other similar tasks. So it is a bit confusing when vos Savant fields such queries from the average Joe (whose IQ is 100) as, What’s the difference between love and fondness? Or what is the nature of luck and coincidence? It’s not obvious how the capacity to visualize objects and to figure out numerical patterns suits one to answer questions that have eluded some of the best poets and philosophers.
Clearly, intelligence encompasses more than a score on a test. Just what does it mean to be smart? How much of intelligence can be specified, and how much can we learn about it from neurology, genetics, computer science and other fields?
The defining term of intelligence in humans still seems to be the IQ score, even though IQ tests are not given as often as they used to be. The test comes primarily in two forms: the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales (both come in adult and children’s version). Generally costing several hundred dollars, they are usually given only by psychologists, although variations of them populate bookstores and the World Wide Web. Superhigh scores like vos Savant’s are no longer possible, because scoring is now based on a statistical population distribution among age peers, rather than simply dividing the mental age by the chronological age and multiplying by 100. Other standardized tests, such as the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and the Graduate Record Exam (GRE), capture the main aspects of IQ tests.
Such standardized tests may not assess all the important elements necessary to succeed in school and in life, argues Robert J. Sternberg. In his article “How Intelligent Is Intelligence Testing?”, Sternberg notes that traditional test best assess analytical and verbal skills but fail to measure creativity and practical knowledge, components also critical to problem solving and life success. Moreover, IQ tests do not necessarily predict so well once populations or situations change. Research has found that IQ predicted leadership skills when the tests were given under low-stress conditions, but under high-stress conditions, IQ was negatively correlated with leadership C that is, it predicted the opposite. Anyone who has toiled through SAT will testify that test-taking skill also matters, whether it’s knowing when to guess or what questions to skip.
26.	Which of the following may be required in an intelligence test?
[A] Answering philosophical questions.
[B] Folding or cutting paper into different shapes.
[C] Telling the differences between certain concepts.
[D] Choosing words or graphs similar to the given ones.
27.	What can be inferred about intelligence testing from Paragraph 3?
[A] People no longer use IQ scores as an indicator of intelligence.
[B] More versions of IQ tests are now available on the Internet.
[C] The test contents and formats for adults and children may be different.
[D] Scientists have defined the important elements of human intelligence.
28.	People nowadays can no longer achieve IQ scores as high as vos Savant’s because
[A] the scores are obtained through different computational procedures.
[B] creativity rather than analytical skills is emphasized now.
[C] vos Savant’s case is an extreme one that will not repeat.
[D] the defining characteristic of IQ tests has changed.
29.	We can conclude from the last paragraph that
[A] test scores may not be reliable indicators of one’s ability.
[B] IQ scores and SAT results are highly correlated.
[C] testing involves a lot of guesswork.
[D] traditional test are out of date.
30.	What is the author’s attitude towards IQ tests?
[A] Supportive.
[B] Skeptical.
[C] Impartial.
[D] Biased.
Text 3
During the past generation, the American middle-class family that once could count on hard work and fair play to keep itself financially secure had been transformed by economic risk and new realities. Now a pink slip, a bad diagnosis, or a disappearing spouse can reduce a family from solidly middle class to newly poor in a few months.
In just one generation, millions of mothers have gone to work, transforming basic family economics. Scholars, policymakers, and critics of all stripes have debated the social implications of these changes, but few have looked at the side effect: family risk has risen as well. Today’s families have budgeted to the limits of their new two-paycheck status. As a result, they have lost the parachute they once had in times of financial setback C a back-up earner (usually Mom) who could go into the workforce if the primary earner got laid off or fell sick. This “added-worker effect” could support the safety net offered by unemployment insurance or disability insurance to help families weather bad times. But today, a disruption to family fortunes can no longer be made up with extra income from an otherwise-stay-at-home partner.
During the same period, families have been asked to absorb much more risk in their retirement income. Steelworkers, airline employees, and now those in the auto industry are joining millions of families who must worry about interest rates, stock market fluctuation, and the harsh reality that they may outlive their retirement money. For much of the past year, President Bush campaigned to move Social Security to a saving-account model, with retirees trading much or all of their guaranteed payments for payments depending on investment returns. For younger families, the picture is not any better. Both the absolute cost of healthcare and the share of it borne by families have risen C and newly fashionable health-savings plans are spreading from legislative halls to Wal-Mart workers, with much higher deductibles and a large new dose of investment risk for families’ future healthcare. Even demographics are working against the middle class family, as the odds of having a weak elderly parent C and all the attendant need for physical and financial assistance C have jumped eightfold in just one generation.
From the middle-class family perspective, much of this, understandably, looks far less like an opportunity to exercise more financial responsibility, and a good deal more like a frightening acceleration of the wholesale shift of financial risk onto their already overburdened shoulders. The financial fallout has begun, and the political fallout may not be far behind.
31.	Today’s double-income families are at greater financial risk in that
[A] the safety net they used to enjoy has disappeared.
[B] their chances of being laid off have greatly increased.
[C] they are more vulnerable to changes in family economics.
[D] they are deprived of unemployment or disability insurance.
32.	As a result of President Bush’s reform, retired people may have
[A] a higher sense of security.
[B] less secured payments.
[C] less chance to invest.
[D] a guaranteed future.
33.	According to the author, health-savings plans will
[A] help reduce the cost of healthcare.
[B] popularize among the middle class.
[C] compensate for the reduced pensions.
[D] increase the families’ investment risk.
34.	It can be inferred from the last paragraph that
[A] financial risks tend to outweigh political risks.
[B] the middle class may face greater political challenges.
[C] financial problems may bring about political problems.
[D] financial responsibility is an indicator of political status.
35.	Which of the following is the best title for this text?
[A] The Middle Class on the Alert
[B] The Middle Class on the Cliff
[C] The Middle Class in Conflict
[D] The Middle Class in Ruins

It never rains but it pours. Just as bosses and boards have finally sorted out their worst accounting and compliance troubles, and improved their feeble corporation governance, a new problem threatens to earn them C especially in America C the sort of nasty headlines that inevitably lead to heads rolling in the executive suite: data insecurity. Left, until now, to odd, low-level IT staff to put right, and seen as a concern only of data-rich industries such as banking, telecoms and air travel, information protection is now high on the boss’s agenda in businesses of every variety.
Several massive leakages of customer and employee data this year C from organizations as diverse as Time Warner, the American defense contractor Science Applications International Corp and even the University of California, Berkeley C have left managers hurriedly peering into their intricate IT systems and business processes in search of potential vulnerabilities.
“Data is becoming an asset which needs to be guarded as much as any other asset,” says Haim Mendelson of Stanford University’s business school. “The ability to guard customer data is the key to market value, which the board is responsible for on behalf of shareholders.” Indeed, just as there is the concept of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), perhaps it is time for GASP, Generally Accepted Security Practices, suggested Eli Noam of New York’s Columbia Business School. “Setting the proper investment level for security, redundancy, and recovery is a management issue, not a technical one,” he says.
The mystery is that this should come as a surprise to any boss. Surely it should be obvious to the dimmest executive that trust, that most valuable of economic assets, is easily destroyed and hugely expensive to restore C and that few things are more likely to destroy trust than a company letting sensitive personal data get into the wrong hands.
The current state of affairs may have been encouraged C though not justified C by the lack of legal penalty (in America, but not Europe) for data leakage. Until California recently passed a law, American firms did not have to tell anyone, even the victim, when data went astray. That may change fast: lots of proposed data-security legislation is now doing the rounds in Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, the theft of information about some 40 million credit-card accounts in America, disclosed on June 17th, overshadowed a hugely important decision a day earlier by America’s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that puts corporate America on notice that regulators will act if firms fail to provide adequate data security.
36.	The statement “It never rains but it pours” is used to introduce
[A] the fierce business competition.
[B] the feeble boss-board relations.
[C] the threat from news reports.
[D] the severity of data leakage.
37.	According to Paragraph 2, some organizations check their systems to find out
[A] whether there is any weak point.
[B] what sort of data has been stolen.
[C] who is responsible for the leakage.
[D] how the potential spies can be located.
38.	In bringing up the concept of GASP the author is making the point that
[A] shareholders’ interests should be properly attended to.
[B] information protection should be given due attention.
[C] businesses should enhance their level of accounting security.
[D] the market value of customer data should be emphasized.
39.	According to Paragraph 4, what puzzles the author is that some bosses fail to
[A] see the link between trust and data protection.
[B] perceive the sensitivity of personal data.
[C] realize the high cost of data restoration.
[D] appreciate the economic value of trust.
40.	It can be inferred from Paragraph 5 that
[A] data leakage is more severe in Europe.
[B] FTC’s decision is essential to data security.
[C] California takes the lead in security legislation.
[D] legal penalty is a major solution to data leakage.

How Can a Parent Help?
Mothers and fathers can do a lot to ensure a safe landing in early adulthood for their kids. Even if a job’s starting salary seems too small to satisfy an emerging adult’s need for rapid content, the transition from school to work can be less of a setback if the start-up adult is ready for the move. Here are a few measures, drawn from my book Ready or Not, Here Life Comes, that parents can take to prevent what I call “work-life unreadiness.”
大41家 http://www.TopSage.com
You can start this process when they are 11 or 12. Periodically review their emerging strengths and weaknesses with them and work together on any shortcomings, like difficulty in communicating well or collaborating. Also, identify the kinds of interests they keep coming back to, as these offer clues to the careers that will fit them best.
大42家 http://www.TopSage.com
Kids need a range of authentic role models C as opposed to members of their clique, pop stars and vaunted athletes. Have regular dinner-table discussions about people the family knows and how they got where they are. Discuss the joys and downsides of your own career and encourage your kids to form some ideas about their own future. When asked what they want to do, they should be discouraged from saying “I have no idea.” They can change their minds 200 times, but having only a foggy view of the future is of little good.
大43家 http://www.TopSage.com
Teachers are responsible for teaching kids how to learn; parents should be responsible for teaching them how to work. Assign responsibilities around the house and make sure homework deadlines are met. Encourage teenagers to take a part-time job. Kids need plenty of practice delaying gratification and deploying effective organizational skills, such as managing time and setting priorities.
大44家 http://www.TopSage.com
Playing video games encourages immediate content. And hours of watching TV shows with canned laughter only teaches kids to process information in a passive way. At the same time, listening through earphones to the same monotonous beats for long stretches encourages kids to stay inside their bubble instead of pursuing other endeavors. All these activities can prevent the growth of important communication and thinking skills and make it difficult for kids to develop the kind of sustained concentration they will need for most jobs.
大45家 http://www.TopSage.com
They should know how to deal with setbacks, stresses and feelings of inadequacy. They should also learn how to solve problems and resolve conflicts, ways to brainstorm and think critically. Discussions at home can help kids practice doing these things and help them apply these skills to everyday life situations.
What about the son or daughter who is grown but seems to be struggling and wandering aimlessly through early adulthood? Parents still have a major role to play, but now it is more delicate. They have to be careful not to come across as disappointed in their child. They should exhibit strong interest and respect for whatever currently interests their fledging adult (as naive or ill conceived as it may seem) while becoming a partner in exploring options for the future. Most of all, these new adults must feel that they are respected and supported by a family that appreciates them.

Read the following text carefully and then translate the underlined segments into Chinese. Your translation should be written clearly on ANSWER SHEET 2. (10 points)
The study of law has been recognized for centuries as a basic intellectual discipline in European universities. However, only in recent years has it become a feature of undergraduate programs in Canadian universities. (46) Traditionally, legal learning has been viewed in such institutions as the special preserve of lawyers, rather than a necessary part of the intellectual equipment of an educated person. Happily, the older and more continental view of legal education is establishing itself in a number of Canadian universities and some have even begun to offer undergraduate degrees in law.
If the study of law is beginning to establish itself as part and parcel of a general education, its aims and methods should appeal directly to journalism educators. Law is a discipline which encourages responsible judgment. On the one hand, it provides opportunities to analyze such ideas as justice, democracy and freedom. (47) On the other, it links these concepts to everyday realities in a manner which is parallel to the links journalists forge on a daily basis as they cover and comment on the news. For example, notions of evidence and fact, of basic rights and public interest are at work in the process of journalistic judgment and production just as in courts of law. Sharpening judgment by absorbing and reflecting on law is a desirable component of a journalist’s intellectual preparation for his or her career.
(48) But the idea that the journalist must understand the law more profoundly than an ordinary citizen rests on an understanding of the established conventions and special responsibilities of the news media. Politics or, more broadly, the functioning of the state, is a major subject for journalists. The better informed they are about the way the state works, the better their reporting will be. (49) In fact, it is difficult to see how journalists who do not have a clear grasp of the basic features of the Canadian Constitution can do a competent job on political stories.
Furthermore, the legal system and the events which occur within it are primary subjects for journalists. While the quality of legal journalism varies greatly, there is an undue reliance amongst many journalists on interpretations supplied to them by lawyers. (50) While comment and reaction from lawyers may enhance stories, it is preferable for journalists to rely on their own notions of significance and make their own judgments. These can only come from a well-grounded understanding of the legal system.

Dear Sir or Madam,
I’m a student in the university and a loyal reader of this library. I’m writing to tell some of my ideas, which I hope to be helpful for you.
I notice that many magazines in our library are out of date. It would be beneficial to us students if they could be updated in time. And I suggest introducing some new journals so as to bring new fresh air to the library. Furthermore, since we have a huge number of books, it is not easy to find the right one easily. However, if we can introduce some new searching means, such as implementing new information management system that would be useful.
Thank you for taking time reading this letter and I’m looking forward to seeing some new changes soon.
Sincerely Yours,

As can be seen from the cartoon, different ideas may come from the same thing. In the picture, while trying to catch the upcoming soccer, the goal-keeper says to himself why it is so big. And, the striker simply thinks in a different way, that is why it is so small?
What makes such a big contrary on the same tournament at the same moment? It is no doubt that they are facing the very same goal and experiencing the very same moment. However, the subjective views result in different impression on the same object. Many of us may still remember the story of a pony crossing the river, which we learned from the textbook in primary school. The squirrel tells him, the river is deep; and the cow tells him, the river is not deep at all. However, in the end, he tells himself a third answer. Therefore, it is not exaggerating to say that most of us are looking into the world with personal ideas. Subjective mental status may result in a really big difference in personal views, just like the goal-keeper and the striker in the drawing.
A possible solution might be to face any situation as objectively as possible. If we realize this in an objective way, it would be good for us to deal with what we encounter in life, especially when we are in setbacks or facing difficulties.

The idea that some groups of people may be more intelligent than others is one of those hypotheses that dare not speak its name. But Gregory Cochran is 大1家 to say it anyway. He is that 大2家 bird, a scientist who works independently 大3家 any institution. He helped popularize the idea that some diseases not 大4家 thought to have a bacterial cause were actually infections, which aroused much controversy when it was first suggested.
大5家 he, however, might tremble at the 大6家 of what he is about to do. Together with another two scientists, he is publishing a paper which not only 大7家 that one group of humanity is more intelligent than the others, but explains the process that has brought this about. The group in 大8家 are a particular people originated from central Europe. The process is natural selection.
This group generally do well in IQ test, 大9家 12-15 points above the 大10家 value of 100, and have contributed 大11家 to the intellectual and cultural life of the West, as the 大12家 of their elites, including several world-renowned scientists, 大13家. They also suffer more often than most people from a number of nasty genetic diseases, such as breast cancer. These facts, 大14家, have previously been thought unrelated. The former has been 大15家 to social effects, such as a strong tradition of 大16家 education. The latter was seen as a (an) 大17家 of genetic isolation. Dr. Cochran suggests that the intelligence and diseases are intimately 大18家. His argument is that the unusual history of these people has 大19家 them to unique evolutionary pressures that have resulted in this 大20家 state of affairs.

While still catching-up to men in some spheres of modern life, women appear to be way ahead in at least one undesirable category. “Women are particularly susceptible to developing depression and anxiety disorders in response to stress compared to men,” according to Dr. Yehuda, chief psychiatrist at New York’s Veteran’s Administration Hospital.
Studies of both animals and humans have shown that sex hormones somehow affect the stress response, causing females under stress to produce more of the trigger chemicals than do males under the same conditions. In several of the studies, when stressed-out female rats had their ovaries (the female reproductive organs) removed, their chemical responses became equal to those of the males.
Adding to a woman’s increased dose of stress chemicals, are her increased “opportunities” for stress. “It’s not necessarily that women don’t cope as well. It’s just that they have so much more to cope with,” says Dr. Yehuda. “Their capacity for tolerating stress may even be greater than men’s,” she observes, “it’s just that they’re dealing with so many more things that they become worn out from it more visibly and sooner.”
Dr. Yehuda notes another difference between the sexes. “I think that the kinds of things that women are exposed to tend to be in more of a chronic or repeated nature. Men go to war and are exposed to combat stress. Men are exposed to more acts of random physical violence. The kinds of interpersonal violence that women are exposed to tend to be in domestic situations, by, unfortunately, parents or other family members, and they tend not to be one-shot deals. The wear-and-tear that comes from these longer relationships can be quite devastating.”
Adeline Alvarez married at 18 and gave birth to a son, but was determined to finish college. “I struggled a lot to get the college degree. I was living in so much frustration that that was my escape, to go to school, and get ahead and do better.” Later, her marriage ended and she became a single mother. “It’s the hardest thing to take care of a teenager, have a job, pay the rent, pay the car payment, and pay the debt. I lived from paycheck to paycheck.”
Not everyone experiences the kinds of severe chronic stresses Alvarez describes. But most women today are coping with a lot of obligations, with few breaks, and feeling the strain. Alvarez’s experience demonstrates the importance of finding ways to diffuse stress before it threatens your health and your ability to function.

[A] need extra doses of chemicals to handle stress.
[B] have limited capacity for tolerating stress.
[C] are more capable of avoiding stress.
[D] are exposed to more stress.
23.	According to Paragraph 4, the stress women confront tends to be
[A] domestic and temporary.
[B] irregular and violent.

It used to be so straightforward. A team of researchers working together in the laboratory would submit the results of their research to a journal. A journal editor would then remove the authors’ names and affiliations from the paper and send it to their peers for review. Depending on the comments received, the editor would accept the paper for publication or decline it. Copyright rested with the journal publisher, and researchers seeking knowledge of the results would have to subscribe to the journal.
No longer. The Internet C and pressure from funding agencies, who are questioning why commercial publishers are making money from government-funded research by restricting access to it C is making access to scientific results a reality. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has just issued a report describing the far-reaching consequences of this. The report, by John Houghton of Victoria University in Australia and Graham Vickery of the OECD, makes heavy reading for publishers who have, so far, made handsome profits. But it goes further than that. It signals a change in what has, until now, been a key element of scientific endeavor.
The value of knowledge and the return on the public investment in research depends, in part, upon wide distribution and ready access. It is big business. In America, the core scientific publishing market is estimated at between $7 billion and $11 billion. The International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers says that there are more than 2,000 publishers worldwide specializing in these subjects. They publish more than 1.2 million articles each year in some 16,000 journals.
This is now changing. According to the OECD report, some 75% of scholarly journals are now online. Entirely new business models are emerging; three main ones were identified by the report’s authors. There is the so-called big deal, where institutional subscribers pay for access to a collection of online journal titles through site-licensing agreements. There is open-access publishing, typically supported by asking the author (or his employer) to pay for the paper to be published. Finally, there are open-access archives, where organizations such as universities or international laboratories support institutional repositories. Other models exist that are hybrids of these three, such as delayed open-access, where journals allow only subscribers to read a paper for the first six months, before making it freely available to everyone who wishes to see it. All this could change the traditional form of the peer-review process, at least for the publication of papers.
26.	In the first paragraph, the author discusses
[A] the background information of journal editing.
[B] the publication routine of laboratory reports.
[C] the relations of authors with journal publishers.
[D] the traditional process of journal publication.
27.	Which of the following is true of the OECD report?
[A] It criticizes government-funded research.
[B] It introduces an effective means of publication.
[C] It upsets profit-making journal publishers.
[D] It benefits scientific research considerably.
28.	According to the text, online publication is significant in that
[A] it provides an easier access to scientific results.
[B] it brings huge profits to scientific researchers.
[C] it emphasizes the crucial role of scientific knowledge.
[D] it facilitates public investment in scientific research.
29.	With the open-access publishing model, the author of a paper is required to
[A] cover the cost of its publication.
[B] subscribe to the journal publishing it.
[C] allow other online journals to use it freely.
[D] complete the peer-review before submission.
30.	Which of the following best summarizes the text?
[A] The Internet is posing a threat to publishers.
[B] A new mode of publication is emerging.
[C] Authors welcome the new channel for publication.
[D] Publication is rendered easier by online service.
Text 3
In the early 1960s Wilt Chamberlain was one of only three players in the National Basketball Association (NBA) listed at over seven feet. If he had played last season, however, he would have been one of 42. The bodies playing major professional sports have changed dramatically over the years, and managers have been more than willing to adjust team uniforms to fit the growing numbers of bigger, longer frames.
The trend in sports, though, may be obscuring an unrecognized reality: Americans have generally stopped growing. Though typically about two inches taller now than 140 years ago, today’s people C especially those born to families who have lived in the U.S. for many generations C apparently reached their limit in the early 1960s. And they aren’t likely to get any taller. “In the general population today, at this genetic, environmental level, we’ve pretty much gone as far as we can go,” says anthropologist William Cameron Chumlea of Wright State University. In the case of NBA players, their increase in height appears to result from the increasingly common practice of recruiting players from all over the world.
Growth, which rarely continues beyond the age of 20, demands calories and nutrients C notably, protein C to feed expanding tissues. At the start of the 20th century, under-nutrition and childhood infections got in the way. But as diet and health improved, children and adolescents have, on average, increased in height by about an inch and a half every 20 years, a pattern known as the secular trend in height. Yet according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, average height C 5′9″ for men, 5′4″ for women C hasn’t really changed since 1960.
Genetically speaking, there are advantages to avoiding substantial height. During childbirth, larger babies have more difficulty passing through the birth canal. Moreover, even though humans have been upright for millions of years, our feet and back continue to struggle with bipedal posture and cannot easily withstand repeated strain imposed by oversize limbs. “There are some real constraints that are set by the genetic architecture of the individual organism,” says anthropologist William Leonard of Northwestern University.
Genetic maximums can change, but don’t expect this to happen soon. Claire C. Gordon, senior anthropologist at the Army Research Center in Natick, Mass., ensures that 90 percent of the uniforms and workstations fit recruits without alteration. She says that, unlike those for basketball, the length of military uniforms has not changed for some time. And if you need to predict human height in the near future to design a piece of equipment, Gordon says that by and large, “you could use today’s data and feel fairly confident.”
31.	Wilt Chamberlain is cited as an example to
[A] illustrate the change of height of NBA players.
[B] show the popularity of NBA players in the U.S..
[C] compare different generations of NBA players.
[D] assess the achievements of famous NBA players.
32.	Which of the following plays a key role in body growth according to the text?
[A] Genetic modification.
[B] Natural environment.
[C] Living standards.
[D] Daily exercise.
33.	On which of the following statements would the author most probably agree?
[A] Non-Americans add to the average height of the nation.
[B] Human height is conditioned by the upright posture.
[C] Americans are the tallest on average in the world.
[D] Larger babies tend to become taller in adulthood.
34.	We learn from the last paragraph that in the near future
[A] the garment industry will reconsider the uniform size.
[B] the design of military uniforms will remain unchanged.
[C] genetic testing will be employed in selecting sportsmen.
[D] the existing data of human height will still be applicable.
35.	The text intends to tell us that
[A] the change of human height follows a cyclic pattern.
[B] human height is becoming even more predictable.
[C] Americans have reached their genetic growth limit.
[D] the genetic pattern of Americans has altered.
Text 4
In 1784, five years before he became president of the United States, George Washington, 52, was nearly toothless. So he hired a dentist to transplant nine teeth into his jaw C having extracted them from the mouths of his slaves.
That’s a far different image from the cherry-tree-chopping George most people remember from their history books. But recently, many historians have begun to focus on the roles slavery played in the lives of the founding generation. They have been spurred in part by DNA evidence made available in 1998, which almost certainly proved Thomas Jefferson had fathered at least one child with his slave Sally Hemings. And only over the past 30 years have scholars examined history from the bottom up. Works of several historians reveal the moral compromises made by the nation’s early leaders and the fragile nature of the country’s infancy. More significantly, they argue that many of the Founding Fathers knew slavery was wrong C and yet most did little to fight it.
More than anything, the historians say, the founders were hampered by the culture of their time. While Washington and Jefferson privately expressed distaste for slavery, they also understood that it was part of the political and economic bedrock of the country they helped to create.
For one thing, the South could not afford to part with its slaves. Owning slaves was “like having a large bank account,” says Wiencek, author of An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America. The southern states would not have signed the Constitution without protections for the “peculiar institution,” including a clause that counted a slave as three fifths of a man for purposes of congressional representation.
And the statesmen’s political lives depended on slavery. The three-fifths formula handed Jefferson his narrow victory in the presidential election of 1800 by inflating the votes of the southern states in the Electoral College. Once in office, Jefferson extended slavery with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803; the new land was carved into 13 states, including three slave states.
Still, Jefferson freed Hemings’s children C though not Hemings herself or his approximately 150 other slaves. Washington, who had begun to believe that all men were created equal after observing the bravery of the black soldiers during the Revolutionary War, overcame the strong opposition of his relatives to grant his slaves their freedom in his will. Only a decade earlier, such an act would have required legislative approval in Virginia.
36.	George Washington’s dental surgery is mentioned to
[A] show the primitive medical practice in the past.
[B] demonstrate the cruelty of slavery in his days.
[C] stress the role of slaves in the U.S. history.
[D] reveal some unknown aspect of his life.
37.	We may infer from the second paragraph that
[A] DNA technology has been widely applied to history research.
[B] in its early days the U.S. was confronted with delicate situations.
[C] historians deliberately made up some stories of Jefferson’s life.
[D] political compromises are easily found throughout the U.S. history.
38.	What do we learn about Thomas Jefferson?
[A] His political view changed his attitude towards slavery.
[B] His status as a father made him free the child slaves.
[C] His attitude towards slavery was complex.
[D] His affair with a slave stained his prestige.
39.	Which of the following is true according to the text?
[A] Some Founding Fathers benefit politically from slavery.
[B] Slaves in the old days did not have the right to vote.
[C] Slave owners usually had large savings accounts.
[D] Slavery was regarded as a peculiar institution.
40.	Washington’s decision to free slaves originated from his
[A] moral considerations.
[B] military experience.
[C] financial conditions.
[D] political stand.

The time for sharpening pencils, arranging your desk, and doing almost anything else instead of writing has ended. The first draft will appear on the page only if you stop avoiding the inevitable and sit, stand up, or lie down to write. (41)是大家网原创出品
Be flexible. Your outline should smoothly conduct you from one point to the next, but do not permit it to railroad you. If a relevant and important idea occurs to you now, work it into the draft. (42) 是大家网原创出品 Grammar, punctuation, and spelling can wait until you revise. Concentrate on what you are saying. Good writing most often occurs when you are in hot pursuit of an idea rather than in a nervous search for errors.
(43) 是大家网原创出品 Your pages will be easier to keep track of that way, and, if you have to clip a paragraph to place it elsewhere, you will not lose any writing on the other side.
If you are working on a word processor, you can take advantage of its capacity to make additions and deletions as well as move entire paragraphs by making just a few simple keyboard commands. Some software programs can also check spelling and certain grammatical elements in your writing. (44) 是大家网原创出品 These printouts are also easier to read than the screen when you work on revisions.
Once you have a first draft on paper, you can delete material that is unrelated to your thesis and add material necessary to illustrate your points and make your paper convincing. The student who wrote “The A & P as a State of Mind” wisely dropped a paragraph that questioned whether Sammy displays chauvinistic attitudes toward women. (45) 是大家网原创出品
Remember that your initial draft is only that. You should go through the paper many times C and then again C working to substantiate and clarify your ideas. You may even end up with several entire versions of the paper. Rewrite. The sentences within each paragraph should be related to a single topic. Transitions should connect one paragraph to the next so that there are no abrupt or confusing shifts. Awkward or wordy phrasing or unclear sentences and paragraphs should be mercilessly poked and prodded into shape.
[A]	To make revising easier, leave wide margins and extra space between lines so that you can easily add words, sentences, and corrections. Write on only one side of the paper.
[B]	After you have clearly and adequately developed the body of your paper, pay particular attention to the introductory and concluding paragraphs. It’s probably best to write the introduction last, after you know precisely what you are introducing. Concluding paragraphs demand equal attention because they leave the reader with a final impression.
[C]	It’s worth remembering, however, that though a clean copy fresh off a printer may look terrific, it will read only as well as the thinking and writing that have gone into it. Many writers prudently store their data on disks and print their pages each time they finish a draft to avoid losing any material because of power failures or other problems.
[D]	It makes no difference how you write, just so you do. Now that you have developed a topic into a tentative thesis, you can assemble your notes and begin to flesh out whatever outline you have made.
[E]	Although this is an interesting issue, it has nothing to do with the thesis, which explains how the setting influences Sammy’s decision to quit his job. Instead of including that paragraph, she added one that described Lengel’s crabbed response to the girls so that she could lead up to the A & P “policy” he enforces.
[F]	In the final paragraph about the significance of the setting in “A & P,” the student brings together the reasons Sammy quit his job by referring to his refusal to accept Lengel’s store policies.
[G]	By using the first draft as a means of thinking about what you want to say, you will very likely discover more than your notes originally suggested. Plenty of good writers don’t use outlines at all but discover ordering principles as they write. Do not attempt to compose a perfectly correct draft the first time around.

In his autobiography, Darwin himself speaks of his intellectual powers with extraordinary modesty. He points out that he always experienced much difficulty in expressing himself clearly and concisely, but (46) he believes that this very difficulty may have had the compensating advantage of forcing him to think long and intently about every sentence, and thus enabling him to detect errors in reasoning and in his own observations. He disclaimed the possession of any great quickness of apprehension or wit, such as distinguished Huxley. (47) He asserted, also, that his power to follow a long and purely abstract train of thought was very limited, for which reason he felt certain that he never could have succeeded with mathematics. His memory, too, he described as extensive, but hazy. So poor in one sense was it that he never could remember for more than a few days a single date or a line of poetry. (48) On the other hand, he did not accept as well founded the charge made by some of his critics that, while he was a good observer, he had no power of reasoning. This, he thought, could not be true, because the “Origin of Species” is one long argument from the beginning to the end, and has convinced many able men. No one, he submits, could have written it without possessing some power of reasoning. He was willing to assert that “I have a fair share of invention, and of common sense or judgment, such as every fairly successful lawyer or doctor must have, but not, I believe, in any higher degree.” (49) He adds humbly that perhaps he was “superior to the common run of men in noticing things which easily escape attention, and in observing them carefully.”
Writing in the last year of his life, he expressed the opinion that in two or three respects his mind had changed during the preceding twenty or thirty years. Up to the age of thirty or beyond it poetry of many kinds gave him great pleasure. Formerly, too, pictures had given him considerable, and music very great, delight. In 1881, however, he said: “Now for many years I cannot endure to read a line of poetry. I have also almost lost my taste for pictures or music.” (50) Darwin was convinced that the loss of these tastes was not only a loss of happiness, but might possibly be injurious to the intellect, and more probably to the moral character.

Research on animal intelligence always makes me wonder just how smart humans are. 大1家 the fruit-fly experiments described in Carl Zimmer's piece in the Science Times on Tuesday.

	Text 1
Habits are a funny thing. We reach for them mindlessly, setting our brains on auto-pilot and relaxing into the unconscious comfort of familiar routine. "Not choice, but habit rules the unreflecting herd," William Wordsworth said in the 19th century. In the ever-changing 21st century, even the word "habit" carries a negative connotation.
So it seems antithetical to talk about habits in the same context as creativity and innovation. But brain researchers have discovered that when we consciously develop new habits, we create parallel synaptic paths, and even entirely new brain cells, that can jump our trains of thought onto new, innovative tracks.
But don't bother trying to kill off old habits; once those ruts of procedure are worn into the hippocampus, they're there to stay. Instead, the new habits we deliberately ingrain into ourselves create parallel pathways that can bypass those old roads.
"The first thing needed for innovation is a fascination with wonder," says Dawna Markova, author of "The Open Mind" and an executive change consultant for Professional Thinking Partners. "But we are taught instead to 'decide,' just as our president calls himself 'the Decider.' " She adds, however, that "to decide is to kill off all possibilities but one. A good innovational thinker is always exploring the many other possibilities."
All of us work through problems in ways of which we're unaware, she says. Researchers in the late 1960 covered that humans are born with the capacity to approach challenges in four primary ways: analytically, procedurally, relationally (or collaboratively) and innovatively. At puberty, however, the brain shuts down half of that capacity, preserving only those modes of thought that have seemed most valuable during the first decade or so of life.
The current emphasis on standardized testing highlights analysis and procedure, meaning that few of us inherently use our innovative and collaborative modes of thought. "This breaks the major rule in the American belief system ― that anyone can do anything," explains M. J. Ryan, author of the 2006 book "This Year I Will..." and Ms. Markova's business partner. "That's a lie that we have perpetuated, and it fosters commonness. Knowing what you're good at and doing even more of it creates excellence." This is where developing new habits comes in.
21.	The view of Wordsworth habit is claimed by being ________.
A. casual       B. familiar     C. mechanical    D. changeable
22.	The researchers have discovered that the formation of habit can be ________
A. predicted    B. regulated    C. traced        D. guided
23.	"ruts"(in line one, paragraph 3) has closest meaning to ________
A. tracks       B. series       C. characteristics  D. connections
24.	Ms. Markova's comments suggest that the practice of standard testing ________?
A, prevents new habits form being formed
B, no longer emphasizes commonness
C, maintains the inherent American thinking model
D, complies with the American belief system
25.	Ryan most probably agree that
A. ideas are born of a relaxing mind
B. innovativeness could be taught
C. decisiveness derives from fantastic ideas
D. curiosity activates creative minds
	Text 2
It is a wise father that knows his own child, but today a man can boost his paternal (fatherly) wisdom C or at least confirm that he's the kid's dad. All he needs to do is shell our $30 for paternity testing kit (PTK) at his local drugstore C and another $120 to get the results.
More than 60,000 people have purchased the PTKs since they first become available without prescriptions last years, according to Doug Fog, chief operating officer of Identigene, which makes the over-the-counter kits. More than two dozen companies sell DNA tests Directly to the public , ranging in price from a few hundred dollars to more than $2500.
Among the most popular : paternity and kinship testing , which adopted children can use to find their biological relatives and latest rage a many passionate genealogists-and supports businesses that offer to search for a family's geographic roots .
Most tests require collecting cells by webbing saliva in the mouth and sending it to the company for testing.  All tests require a potential candidate with whom to compare DNA.
But some observers are skeptical, "There is a kind of false precision being hawked by people claiming they are doing ancestry testing," says Trey Duster, a New York University sociologist. He notes that each individual has many ancestors-numbering in the hundreds just a few centuries back. Yet most ancestry testing only considers a single lineage, either the Y chromosome inherited through men in a father's line or mitochondrial DNA, which a passed down only from mothers. This DNA can reveal genetic information about only one or two ancestors, even though, for example, just three generations back people also have six other great-grandparents or, four generations back, 14 other great-great-grandparents.
Critics also argue that commercial genetic testing is only as good as the reference collections to which a sample is compared. Databases used by some companies don't rely on data collected systematically but rather lump together information from different research projects. This means that a DNA database may differ depending on the company that processes the results. In addition, the computer programs a company uses to estimate relationships may be patented and not subject to peer review or outside evaluation.

[D] achieve the claimed accuracy
29.	In the last paragraph, a problem commercial genetic testing faces is __________.
[A] disorganized data collection
[B] overlapping database building

	Text 3
The relationship between formal education and economic growth in poor countries is widely misunderstood by economists and politicians alike progress in both area is undoubtedly necessary for the social, political and intellectual development of these and all other societies; however, the conventional view that education should be one of the very highest priorities for promoting rapid economic development in poor countries is wrong. We are fortunate that is it, because new educational systems there and putting enough people through them to improve economic performance would require two or three generations. The findings of a research institution have consistently shown that workers in all countries can be trained on the job to achieve radical higher productivity and, as a result, radically higher standards of living.
Ironically, the first evidence for this idea appeared in the United States. Not long ago, with the country entering a recessing and Japan at its pre-bubble peak. The U.S. workforce was derided as poorly educated and one of primary cause of the poor U.S. economic performance. Japan was, and remains, the global leader in automotive-assembly productivity. Yet the research revealed that the U.S. factories of Honda Nissan, and Toyota achieved about 95 percent of the productivity of their Japanese counterparts -- a result of the training that U.S. workers received on the job.
More recently, while examining housing construction, the researchers discovered that illiterate, non-English- speaking Mexican workers in Houston, Texas, consistently met best-practice labor productivity standards despite the complexity of the building industry's work.
What is the real relationship between education and economic development? We have to suspect that continuing economic growth promotes the development of education even when governments don't force it. After all, that's how education got started. When our ancestors were hunters and gatherers 10,000 years ago, they didn't have time to wonder much about anything besides finding food. Only when humanity began to get its food in a more productive way was there time for other things.
As education improved, humanity's productivity potential, they could in turn afford more education. This increasingly high level of education is probably a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for the complex political systems required by advanced economic performance. Thus poor countries might not be able to escape their poverty traps without political changes that may be possible only with broader formal education. A lack of formal education, however, doesn't constrain the ability of the developing world's workforce to substantially improve productivity for the forested future. On the contrary, constraints on improving productivity explain why education isn't developing more quickly there than it is.
31.	The author holds in paragraph 1 that the important of education in poor countries  ___________.
[A] is subject groundless doubts
[B] has fallen victim of bias
[C] is conventional downgraded
[D] has been overestimated
32.	It is stated in paragraph 1 that construction of a new education system  __________.
[A] challenges economists and politicians
[B] takes efforts of generations
[C] demands priority from the government
[D] requires sufficient labor force
33.	A major difference between the Japanese and U.S workforces is that __________.
[A] the Japanese workforce is better disciplined
[B] the Japanese workforce is more productive
[C] the U.S workforce has a better education
[D] the U.S workforce is more organize
34.	The author quotes the example of our ancestors to show that education emerged __________.
[A] when people had enough time
[B] prior to better ways of finding food
[C] when people on longer went hung
[D] as a result of pressure on government
35.	According to the last paragraph , development of education __________.
[A] results directly from competitive environments
[B] does not depend on economic performance
[C] follows improved productivity
[D] cannot afford political changes
	Text 4
The most thoroughly studied in the history of the new world are the ministers and political leaders of seventeenth-century New England. According to the standard history of American philosophy, nowhere else in colonial America was "So much important attached to intellectual pursuits " According to many books and articles, New England's leaders established the basic themes and preoccupations of an unfolding, dominant Puritan tradition in American intellectual life.
To take this approach to the New Englanders normally mean to start with the Puritans' theological innovations and their distinctive ideas about the church-important subjects that we may not neglect. But in keeping with our examination of southern intellectual life, we may consider the original Puritans as carriers of European culture adjusting to New world circumstances. The New England colonies were the scenes of important episodes in the pursuit of widely understood ideals of civility and virtuosity.
The early settlers of Massachusetts Bay included men of impressive education and influence in England. `Besides the ninety or so learned ministers who came to Massachusetts church in the decade after 1629,There were political leaders like John Winthrop, an educated gentleman, lawyer, and official of the Crown before he journeyed to Boston. There men wrote and published extensively, reaching both New World and Old World audiences, and giving New England an atmosphere of intellectual earnestness.
We should not forget , however, that most New Englanders were less well educated. While few crafts men or farmers, let alone dependents and servants, left literary compositions to be analyzed, The in thinking often had a traditional superstitions quality. A tailor named John Dane, who emigrated in the late 1630s, left an account of his reasons for leaving England that is filled with signs. sexual confusion, economic frustrations , and religious hope-all name together in a decisive moment when he opened the Bible, told his father the first line he saw would settle his fate, and read the magical words: "come out from among them, touch no unclean thing , and I will be your God and you shall be my people." One wonders what Dane thought of the careful sermons explaining the Bible that he heard in puritan churched.
Meanwhile, many settles had slighter religious commitments than Dane's, as one clergyman learned in confronting folk along the coast who mocked that they had not come to the New world for religion . "Our main end was to catch fish. "
36.	The author notes that in the seventeenth-century New England___________.
[A] Puritan tradition dominated political life.
[B] intellectual interests were encouraged.
[C] Politics benefited much from intellectual endeavors.
[D] intellectual pursuits enjoyed a liberal environment.
37.	It is suggested in paragraph 2 that New Englanders__________.
[A] experienced a comparatively peaceful early history.
[B] brought with them the culture of the Old World
[C] paid little attention to southern intellectual life
[D] were obsessed with religious innovations
38.	The early ministers and political leaders in Massachusetts Bay__________.
[A] were famous in the New World for their writings
[B] gained increasing importance in religious affairs
[C] abandoned high positions before coming to the New World
[D] created a new intellectual atmosphere in New England
39.	The story of John Dane shows that less well-educated New Englanders were often __________.
[A] influenced by superstitions
[B] troubled with religious beliefs
[C] puzzled by church sermons
[D] frustrated with family earnings
40.	The text suggests that early settlers in New England__________.
[A] were mostly engaged in political activities
[B] were motivated by an illusory prospect
[C] came from different backgrounds.
[D] left few formal records for later reference

Coinciding with the groundbreaking theory of biological evolution proposed by British naturalist Charles Darwin in the 1860s, British social philosopher Herbert Spencer put forward his own theory of biological and cultural evolution. Spencer argued that all worldly phenomena, including human societies, changed over time, advancing toward perfection. 41.____________.
American social scientist Lewis Henry Morgan introduced another theory of cultural evolution in the late 1800s. Morgan, along with Tylor, was one of the founders of modern anthropology. In his work, he attempted to show how all aspects of culture changed together in the evolution of societies.42._____________.
In the early 1900s in North America, German-born American anthropologist Franz Boas developed a new theory of culture known as historical particularism. Historical particularism, which emphasized the uniqueness of all cultures, gave new direction to anthropology. 43._____________.
Boas felt that the culture of any society must be understood as the result of a unique history and not as one of many cultures belonging to a broader evolutionary stage or type of culture. 44._______________.
Historical particularism became a dominant approach to the study of culture in American anthropology, largely through the influence of many students of Boas. But a number of anthropologists in the early 1900s also rejected the particularist theory of culture in favor of diffusionism. Some attributed virtually every important cultural achievement to the inventions of a few, especially gifted peoples that, according to diffusionists, then spread to other cultures. 45.________________.
Also in the early 1900s, French sociologist émile Durkheim developed a theory of culture that would greatly influence anthropology. Durkheim proposed that religious beliefs functioned to reinforce social solidarity. An interest in the relationship between the function of society and culture―known as functionalism―became a major theme in European, and especially British, anthropology.
[A]	Other anthropologists believed that cultural innovations, such as inventions, had a single origin and passed from society to society. This theory was known as diffusionism.
[B]	In order to study particular cultures as completely as possible, Boas became skilled in linguistics, the study of languages, and in physical anthropology, the study of human biology and anatomy.
[C]	He argued that human evolution was characterized by a struggle he called the "survival of the fittest," in which weaker races and societies must eventually be replaced by stronger, more advanced races and societies.
[D]	They also focused on important rituals that appeared to preserve a people's social structure, such as initiation ceremonies that formally signify children's entrance into adulthood.
[E]	Thus, in his view, diverse aspects of culture, such as the structure of families, forms of marriage, categories of kinship, ownership of property, forms of government, technology, and systems of food production, all changed as societies evolved.
[F]	Supporters of the theory viewed as a collection of integrated parts that work together to keep a society functioning.
[G]	For example, British anthropologists Grafton Elliot Smith and W. J. Perry incorrectly suggested, on the basis of inadequate information, that farming, pottery making, and metallurgy all originated in ancient Egypt and diffused throughout the world. In fact, all of these cultural developments occurred separately at different times in many parts of the world.

There is a marked difference between the education which everyone gets from living with others, and the deliberate educating of the young. In the former case the education is incidental; it is natural and important, but it is not the express reason of the association. (46) It may be said that the measure of the worth of any social institution is its effect in enlarging and improving experience; but this effect is not a part of its original motive. Religious associations began, for example, in the desire to secure the favor of overruling powers and to ward off evil influences; family life in the desire to gratify appetites and secure family perpetuity; systematic labor, for the most part, because of enslavement to others, etc. (47) Only gradually was the by-product of the institution noted, and only more gradually still was this effect considered as a directive factor in the conduct of the institution. Even today, in our industrial life, apart from certain values of industriousness and thrift, the intellectual and emotional reaction of the forms of human association under which the world's work is carried on receives little attention as compared with physical output.
But in dealing with the young, the fact of association itself as an immediate human fact, gains in importance. (48) While it is easy to ignore in our contact with them the effect of our acts upon their disposition, it is not so easy as in dealing with adults. The need of training is too evident; the pressure to accomplish a change in their attitude and habits is too urgent to leave these consequences wholly out of account. (49) Since our chief business with them is to enable them to share in a common life we cannot help considering whether or no we are forming the powers which will secure this ability. If humanity has made some headway in realizing that the ultimate value of every institution is its distinctively human effect we may well believe that this lesson has been learned largely through dealings with the young.
(50) We are thus led to distinguish, within the broad educational process which we have been so far considering, a more formal kind of education -- that of direct tuition or schooling. In undeveloped social groups, we find very little formal teaching and training. These groups mainly rely for instilling needed dispositions into the young upon the same sort of association which keeps the adults loyal to their group.

Vividly depicted in the cartoon is a race of humans on a social network that are isolated in their own little cubicles. They are all sitting in front of their computers, connected to each other through the Internet and their devoted looks and postures showed their addiction to the Internet.
This cartoon, I believe, intends to draw our attentions to the negative effects the Internet has brought to our daily life as it brings in some benefits, such as easy access to information, instant communication with people from afar and cheap cost of communication. The more people are hooked to the Net, the more isolated they are from the real world. Since people can easily pretend their identities on the Internet, everything online becomes illusive and untrustworthy. The Internet, which was intended to bring people closer to each other, in effect prevents people from making real acquaintances that one can make with a casual exchange of greetings and eye-contact in a face-to-face communication.
Serious consequences, such as fear of real-time interactions, online cheating or blackmailing, may follow if the use of the Internet is not brought under systematic control. I strongly suggest that people only use the Internet for necessary business transactions and personal contacts with those they have already known face to face.

　　Text 1
　　First two hours, now three hours ― this is how far in advance authorities are recommending people show up to catch a domestic flight, at least at some major U.S. airports with increasingly massive security lines.
　　Americans are willing to tolerate time-consuming security protocols in return for increased safety. The crash of Egypt Air Flight 804, which terrorists may have downed over the Mediterranean Sea, provides another tragic reminder of why. But demanding too much of air travelers or providing too little security in return undermines public support for the process. And it should: Wasted time is a drag on Americans' economic and private lives, not to mention infuriating.
　　Last year, the Transportation Security Administration(TSA) found in a secret check that undercover investigators were able to sneak weapons ― both fake and real ― past airport security nearly every time they tried. Enhanced security measures since then, combined with a rise in airline travel due to the improving economy and low oil prices, have resulted in long waits at major airports such as Chicago's O'Hare International. It is not yet clear how much more effective airline security has become ― but the lines are obvious.
　　Part of the issue is that the government did not anticipate the steep increase in airline travel, so the TSA is now rushing to get new screeners on the line. Part of the issue is that airports have only so much room for screening lanes. Another factor may be that more people are trying to overpack their carry-on bags to avoid checked-baggage fees, though the airlines strongly dispute this.
　　There is one step the TSA could take that would not require remodeling airports or rushing to hire: Enroll more people in the PreCheck program. PreCheck is supposed to be a win-win for travelers and the TSA. Passengers who pass a background check are eligible to use expedited screening lanes. This allows the TSA to focus on travelers who are higher risk, saving time for everyone involved. TSA wants to enroll 25 million people in PreCheck.

　　It has not gotten anywhere close to that, and one big reason is sticker shock: Passengers must pay $85 every five years to process their background checks. Since the beginning, this price tag has been PreCheck's fatal flaw. Upcoming reforms might bring the price to a more reasonable level. But Congress should look into doing so directly, by helping to finance PreCheck enrollment or to cut costs in other ways.
　　The TSA cannot continue diverting resources into underused PreCheck lanes while most of the traveling public suffers in unnecessary lines. It is long past time to make the program work.

　　21. The crash of Egypt Air Flight 804 is mentioned to____
　　[A] explain American’s tolerance of current security checks.
　　[B] stress the urgency to strengthen security worldwide.
　　[C] highlight the necessity of upgrading major U.S. airports.
　　[D] emphasize the importance of privacy protection.
　　
　　22. Which of the following contributes to long waits at major airports?
　　[A] New restrictions on carry-on bags.
　　[B] The declining efficiency of the TSA.
　　[C] An increase in the number of travellers.
　　[D] Frequent unexpected secret checks.

　　23. The word “expedited” (Liner 4, Para. 5) is closet in meaning to____
　　[A] quieter.
　　[B] cheaper.
　　[C] wider.
　　[D] faster.

　　“The ancient Hawaiians were astronomers,” wrote Queen Liliuokalani, Hawaii's last reigning monarch, in 1897. Star watchers were among the most esteemed members of Hawaiian society. Sadly, all is not well with astronomy in Hawaii today. Protests have erupted over construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), a giant observatory that promises to revolutionize humanity's view of the cosmos.
　　At issue is the TMT's planned location on Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano worshiped by some Hawaiians as the piko, that connects the Hawaiian Islands to the heavens. But Mauna Kea is also home to some of the world's most powerful telescopes. Rested in the Pacific Ocean, Mauna Kea's peak rises above the bulk of our planet's dense atmosphere, where conditions allow telescopes to obtain images of unsurpassed clarity.
　　Opposition to telescopes on Mauna Kea is nothing new. A small but vocal group of Hawaiians and environmentalists have long viewed their presence as disrespect far sacred land and a painful reminder of the occupation of what was once a sovereign nation.
　　Some blame for the current controversy belongs to astronomers. In their eagerness to build bigger telescopes, they forgot that science is not the only way of understanding the world. They did not always prioritize the protection of Mauna Kea's fragile ecosystems or its holiness to the islands' inhabitants. Hawaiian culture is not a relic of the past； it is a living culture undergoing a renaissance today.
　　Yet science has a cultural history, too, with roots going back to the dawn of civilization. The same curiosity to find what lies beyond the horizon that first brought early Polynesians to Hawaii's shores inspires astronomers today to explore the heavens. Calls to disassemble all telescopes on Mauna Kea or to ban future development there ignore the reality that astronomy and Hawaiian culture both seek to answer big questions about who we are, where we come from and where we are going. Perhaps that is why we explore the starry skies, as if answering a primal calling to know ourselves and our true ancestral homes.
　　The astronomy community is making compromises to change its use of Mauna Kea. The TMT site was chosen to minimize the telescope’s visibility around the island and to avoid archaeological and environmental impact. To limit the number of telescopes on Mauna Kea, old ones will be removed at the end of their lifetimes and their sites returned to a natural state. There is no reason why everyone cannot be welcomed on Mauna Kea to embrace their cultural heritage and to study the stars.

　　26. Queen Liliuokalani’s remark in Paragraph 1 indicates____
　　[A] her conservative view on the historical role of astronomy.
　　[B] the importance of astronomy in ancient Hawaiian society.
　　[C]the regrettable decline of astronomy in ancient times.
　　[D] her appreciation of star watchers’ feats in her time.

　　28. The construction of the TMT is opposed by some locals partly because____
　　[A] it may risk ruining their intellectual life.
　　[B] it reminds them of a humiliating history.
　　[C] their culture will lose a chance of revival.
　　[D] they fear losing control of Mauna Kea.

　　
　　29. It can be inferred from Paragraph 5 that progress in today’s astronomy____
　　[A] is fulfilling the dreams of ancient Hawaiians.
　　[B] helps spread Hawaiian culture across the world.

　　Robert F. Kennedy once said that a country’s GDP measures “everything except that which makes life worthwhile.” With Britain voting to leave the European Union, and GDP already predicted to slow as a result, it is now a timely moment to assess what he was referring to.
　　The question of GDP and its usefulness has annoyed policymakers for over half a century. Many argue that it is a flawed concept. It measures things that do not matter and miss things that do. By most recent measures, the UK’s GDP has been the envy of the Western World, with record low unemployment and high growth figures. If everything was going so so well, then why did over 17million people vote for Brexit, despite the warnings about what it could do to their country’s economic prospects?
　　A recent annual study of countries and their ability to convert growth into well-being sheds some light on that question. Across the 163 countries measured, the UK is one of the poorest performers in ensuring that economic growth is translated into meaningful improvement for its citizens. Rather than just focusing on GDR over 40 different sets of criteria from health, education and civil society engagement have been measured to get a more rounded  assessment of how countries are performing.
　　While all of these countries face their own challenges, there are a number of consistent themes. Yes, there has been a budding economic recovery since the 2008 global crash, but in key indicators in areas such as health and education, major economies have continued to decline. Yet this isn't the case with all countries. Some relatively poor European countries have seen huge improvements across measures including civil society; income equality and the environment.
　　This is a lesson that rich countries can learn: When GDP is no longer regarded as the sole measure of a country’s success, the world looks very different.
　　So what Kennedy was referring to was that while GDP has been the most common method for measuring the economic activity of nations, as a measure, it is no longer enough. It does not include important factors such as environmental equality or education outcomes - all things that contribute to a person's sense of well-being.
　　The sharp hit to growth predicted around the world and in the UK could lead to a decline in the everyday services we depend on for our well-being and for growth. But policymaker who refocus efforts on improving well-being rather than simply worrying about GDP figures could avoid the forecasted doom and may even see progress.
　　31. Robert F. Kennedy is cited because he_____
　　[A]praised the UK for its GDP.
　　[B]identified GDP with happiness.
　　[C]misinterpreted the role of GDP.
　　[D]had a low opinion of GDP.
　　
　　32. It can be inferred from Paragraph 2 that____
　　[A]the UK is reluctant to remold its economic pattern.
　　[B]the UK will contribute less to the world economy.
　　[C]GDP as the measure of success is widely defied in the UK.
　　[D]policymakers in the UK are paying less attention to GDP.
　　
　　33. Which of the following is true about the recent annual study?
　　[A]It excludes GDP as an indicator.
　　[B]It is sponsored by 163 countries.
　　[C]Its criteria are questionable.
　　[D]Its results are enlightening.

　　34. In the last two paragraphs, the author suggests that____
　　[A]the UK is preparing for an economic boom.
　　[B]high GDP foreshadows an economic decline.
　　[C]it is essential to consider factors beyond GDP.
　　[D]it requires caution to handle economic issues.

　　35. Which of the following is the best??for the text?

　　In a rare unanimous ruling, the US Supreme Court has overturned the corruption conviction of a former Virginia governor, Robert McDonnell. But it did so while holding its nose at the ethics of his conduct, which included accepting gifts such as a Rolex watch and a Ferrari Automobile from a company seeking access to government.
　　The high court’s decision said the judge in Mr. McDonnell’s trail failed to tell a jury that it must look only at his “official acts,” or the former governor’s decisions on “specific” and “unsettled” issues related to his duties.
　　Merely helping a gift-giver gain access to other officials, unless done with clear intent to pressure those officials, is not corruption, the justices found.
　　The court did suggest that accepting favors in return for opening doors is “distasteful” and “nasty.” But under anti-bribery laws, proof must be made of concrete benefits, such as approval of a contract or regulation. Simply arranging a meeting, making a phone call, or hosting an event is not an “official act.”
　　The court’s ruling is legally sound in defining a kind of favoritism that is not criminal. Elected leaders must be allowed to help supporters deal with bureaucratic problems without fear of prosecution of bribery. “The basic compact underlying representative government,” wrote Chief Justice John Roberts for the court, “assumes that public officials will hear from their constituents and act on their concerns.”
　　But the ruling reinforces the need for citizens and their elected representatives, not the courts, to ensure equality of access to government. Officials must not be allowed to play favorites in providing information or in arranging meetings simply because an individual or group provides a campaign donation or a personal gift. This type of integrity requires will-enforced laws in government transparency, such as records of official meetings, rules on lobbying, and information about each elected leader’s source of wealth.
　　Favoritism in official access can fan public perceptions of corruption. But it is not always corruption. Rather officials must avoid double standards, or different types of access for average people and the wealthy. If connections can be bought, a basic premise of democratic society C that all are equal in treatment by government- is undermined. Good government rests on an understanding of the inherent worth of each individual.
　　The court’s ruling is a step forward in the struggle against both corruption and official favoritism.
　　36. The underlined sentence(Para.1) most probably shows that the court____
　　[A] avoided defining the extent of McDonnell’s duties.
　　[B] made no compromise in convicting McDonnell.
　　[C] was contemptuous of McDonnell’s conduct.
　　[D] refused to comment on McDonnell’s ethics.
　　
　　37. According to Paragraph 4, an official act is deemed corruptive only if it involves____
    [A] concrete returns for gift-givers.
　　[B] sizable gains in the form of gifts.
　　[C] leaking secrets intentionally.
　　[D] breaking contracts officially.

　　38. The court’s ruling is d on the assumption that public officials are__
　　[A] allowed to focus on the concerns of their supporters.
　　[B] qualified to deal independently with bureaucratic issues.
　　[C] justified in addressing the needs of their constituents.
　　[D] exempt from conviction on the charge of favoritism.

　　39. Well-enforced laws in government transparency are needed to___
　　[A] awaken the conscience of officials.
　　[B] guarantee fair play in official access.
　　[C] allow for certain kinds of lobbying.
　　[D] inspire hopes in average people.

　　40. The author’s attitude toward the court’s ruling is____
　　[A] sarcastic.
　　[B] tolerant.
　　[C] skeptical.

　　[A]The first published sketch, "A Dinner at Poplar Walk" brought tears to Dickens's eyes when he discovered it in the pages of The Monthly Magazine. From then on his sketches ,which appeared under the pen name "Boz" in The Evening Chronicle, earned him a modest reputation.
　　[B]The runaway success of The Pickwick Papers, as it is generally known today, secured Dickens's fame. There were Pickwick coats and Pickwick cigars, and the plump, spectacled hero, Samuel Pickwick, became a national figure.
　　[C]Soon after Sketches by Boz appeared, a publishing firm approached Dickens to write a story in monthly installments, as a backdrop for a series of woodcuts by the ten-famous artist Robert Seymour, who had originated the idea for the story. With characteristic confidence, Dickens successfully insisted that Seymour's pictures illustrate his own story instead. After the first installment, Dickens wrote to the artist and asked him to correct a drawing Dickens felt was not faithful enough to his prose. Seymour made the change, went into his backyard, and expressed his displeasure by committing suicide. Dickens and his publishers simply pressed on with a new artist. The comic novel, The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club, appeared serially in 1836 and 1837, and was first published in book form in 1837.
　　[D]Charles Dickens is probably the best-known and, to many people, the greatest English novelist of the 19th century. A moralist, satirist, and social reformer. Dickens crafted complex plots and striking characters that capture the panorama of English society.
　　[E]Soon after his father's release from prison, Dickens got a better job as errand boy in law offices. He taught himself shorthand to get an even better job later as a court stenographer and as a reporter in Parliament. At the same time, Dickens, who had a reporter's eye for transcribing the life around him especially anything comic or odd, submitted short sketches to obscure magazines.
　　[F] Dickens was born in Portsmouth, on England's southern coast. His father was a clerk in the British navy pay office -a respectable position, but wish little social status. His paternal grandparents, a steward and a housekeeper possessed even less status, having been servants, and Dickens later concealed their background. Dicken's mother supposedly came from a more respectable family. Yet two years before Dicken's birth, his mother's father was caught stealing and fled to Europe, never to return. The family's increasing poverty forced Dickens out of school at age 12 to work in Warren's Blacking Warehouse, a shoe-polish factory, where the other working boys mocked him as "the young gentleman." His father was then imprisoned for debt. The humiliations of his father's imprisonment and his labor in the blacking factory formed Dicken's greatest wound and became his deepest secret. He could not confide them even to his wife, although they provide the unacknowledged foundation of his fiction.
　　[G] After Pickwick, Dickens plunged into a bleaker world. In Oliver Twist, e traces an orphan's progress from the workhouse to the criminal slums of London. Nicholas Nickleby, his next novel, combines the darkness of Oliver Twist with the sunlight of Pickwick. The popularity of these novels consolidated Dichens' as a nationally and internationally celebrated man of letters.

　　The growth of the use of English as the world`s primary language for international communication has obviously been continuing for several decades.
　　(46)But even as the number of English speakers expands further there are signs that the global predominance of the language may fade within the foreseeable future.
　　Complex international, economic, technological and culture change could start to diminish the leading position of English as the language of the world market, and UK interests which enjoy advantage from the breath of English usage would consequently face new pressures. Those realistic possibilities are highlighted in the study presented by David Graddol
　　(47)His analysis should therefore end any self-contentedness among those who may believe that the global position of English is so stable that the young generation of the United Kingdom do not need additional language capabilities.
　　David Graddol concludes that monoglot English graduates face a bleak economic future as qualified multilingual youngsters from other countries are proving to have a competitive advantage over their British counterparts in global companies and organizations. Alongside that,(48)many countries are introducing English into the primary-school curriculum but British schoolchildren and students do not appear to be gaining greater encouragement to achieve fluency in other languages.
　　If left to themselves, such trends will diminish the relative strength of the English language in international education markets as the demand for educational resources in languages, such as Spanish ,Arabic or Mandarin grows and international business process outsourcing in other language such as Japanese, French and German, spreads.
　　(49)The changes identified by David Graddol all present clear and major challenges to UK`s providers of English language teaching to people of other countries and to broader education business sectors. The English language teaching sector directly earns nearly &1.3 billion for the UK in invisible exports and our other education related explores earn up to &10 billion a year more. As the international education market expands, the recent slowdown in the number of international students studying in the main English-speaking countries is likely to continue, especially if there are no effective strategic policies to prevent such slippage.
　　The anticipation of possible shifts in demand provided by this study is significant:(50) It gives a basis to all organization which seek to promote the learning and use of English,a basis for planning to meet the possibilities of what could be a very different operating environment.That is a necessary and practical approach. In this as in much else, those who wish to influence the future must prepare for it.

　Text 1
France, which prides itself as the global innovator of fashion, has decided its fashion industry has lost an absolute right to define physical beauty for women. Its lawmakers gave preliminary approval last week to a law that would make it a crime to employ ultra-thin models on runaways. The parliament also agreed to ban websites that “incite excessive thinness” by promoting extreme dieting. 
Such measures have a couple of uplifting motives. They suggest beauty should not be defined by looks that end up impinging on health. That’s a start. And the ban on ultra-thin models seems to go beyond protecting models from starving themselves to death-as some have done. It tells the fashion industry that it must take responsibility for the signal it sends women, especially teenage girls, about the social tape-measure they must use to determine their individual worth.
The bans, if fully enforced,would suggest to women (and many men) that they should not let others be arbiters of their beauty. And perhaps faintly,they hint that people should look to intangible qualities like character and intellect rather than dieting their way to size zero or wasp-waist physiques. 
The French measures, however, rely too much on severe punishment to change a culture that still regards beauty as skin-deep-and bone-showing. Under the law, using a fashion model that does not meet a government-defined index of body mass could result in a $85,000 fine and six months in prison.
The fashion industry knows it has an inherent problem in focusing on material adornment and idealized body types. In Denmark, the United States, and a few other countries, it is trying to set voluntary standards for models and fashion images that rely more on peer pressure for enforcement.
In contrast to France’s actions, Denmark’s fashion industry agreed last month on rules and sanctions regarding the age, health, and other characteristics of models. The newly revised Danish Fashion Ethical Charter clearly states: “We are aware of and take responsibility for the impact the fashion industry has on body ideals, especially on young people.” The charter’s main tool of enforcement is to deny access for designers and modeling agencies to Copenhagen Fashion Week (CFW), which is run by the Danish Fashion Institute. But in general it relies on a name-and-shame method of compliance. 
Relying on ethical persuasion rather than law to address the misuse of body ideals may be the best step. Even better would be to help elevate notions of beauty beyond the material standards of a particular industry. 
21. According to the first paragraph, what would happen in France?
 [A]New runways would be constructed.
 [B]Physical beauty would be redefined. 
[C]Websites about dieting would thrive.
 [D]The fashion industry would decline. 
22. The phrase “impinging on” (Line2, Para.2) is closest in meaning to.
[A]heightening the value of. 
[B]indicating the state of. 
[C]losing faith in. 
[D]doing harm to.
23. Which of the following is true of the fashion industry?
[A]New standards are being set in Denmark. 
[B]The French measures have already failed. 
[C]Models are no longer under peer pressure. 
[D]Its inherent problems are getting worse.  
24. A designer is most likely to be rejected by CFW for .
[A]pursuing perfect physical conditions. 
[B]caring too much about models’ character. 
[C]showing little concern for health factors. 
[D]setting a high age threshold for models.  
25. Which of the following may be the best title of the text?

  For the first time in history more people live in towns than in the country. In Britain this has had a curious result. While polls show Britons rate “the countryside” alongside the royal family, Shakespeare and the National Health Service (NHS) as what makes them proudest of their country, this has limited political support. 
  A century ago Octavia Hill launched the National Trust not to rescue stylish houses but to save “the beauty of natural places for everyone forever.” It was specifically to provide city dwellers with spaces for leisure where they could experience “a refreshing air.” Hill’s pressures later led to the creation of national parks and green belts. They don’t make countryside any more, and every year concrete consumes more of it. It needs constant guardianship. 
At the next election none of the big parties seem likely to endorse this sentiment. The Conservatives’ planning reform explicitly gives rural development priority over conservation, even authorizing“off-plan” building where local people might object. The concept of sustainable development has been defined as profitable. Labour likewise wants to discontinue local planning where councils oppose development. The Liberal Democrats are silent. Only Ukip, sensing its chance, has sided with those pleading for a more considered approach to using green land. Its Campaign to Protect Rural England struck terror into many local Conservative parties. 
The sensible place to build new houses, factories and offices is where people are, in cities and towns where infrastructure is in place. The London agents StirlingAckroyd recently identified enough sites for half a million houses in the London area alone, with no intrusion on green belt. What is true of London is even truer of the provinces. 
  The idea that “housing crisis” equals “concreted meadows” is pure lobby talk. The issue is not the need for more houses but, as always, where to put them. Under lobby pressure, George Osborne favours rural new-build against urban renovation and renewal. He favours out-of-town shopping sites against high streets. This is not a free market but a biased one. Rural towns and villages have grown and will always grow. They do so best where building sticks to their edges and respects their character. We do not ruin urban conservation areas. Why ruin rural ones? 
  Development should be planned, not let rip. After the Netherlands, Britain is Europe’s most crowded country. Half a century of town and country planning has enabled it to retain an enviable rural coherence, while still permitting low-density urban living. There is no doubt of the alternative―the corrupted landscapes of southern Portugal, Spain or Ireland. Avoiding this rather than promoting it should unite the left and right of the political spectrum. 
26. Britain’s public sentiment about the countryside.
[A]didn’tstart till the Shakespearean age. 
[B]has brought much benefit to the NHS. 
[C]is fully backed by the royal family. 
[D]is not well reflected in politics.  
27. According to Paragraph 2, the achievements of the National Trust are now being____ .
[A]gradually destroyed. 
[B]effectively reinforced. 
[C]largely overshadowed.

[A]Labour is under attack for opposing development.
[B]The Conservatives may abandon “off-plan” building. 
[C]The Liberal Democrats are losing political influence.
[D]Ukip may gain from its support for rural conservation.  
29. The author holds that George Osborne’s preference____ .
[A]highlights his firm stand against lobby pressure. 
[B]shows his disregard for the character of rural areas. 
[C]stresses the necessity of easing the housing crisis. 
[D]reveals a strong prejudice against urban areas.

[A]the size of population in Britain. 
[B]the political life in today’s Britain. 
[C]the enviable urban lifestyle in Britain. 
[D]the town-and-country planning in Britain.

“There is one and only one social responsibility of business,” wrote Milton Friedman,a Nobel prize-winning economist “That is, to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits.” But even if you accept Fiedman’s premise and regard corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies as a waste of shareholders money,things may not be absolutely clear-cut.New research suggests that CSR may create monetary value for companies Cat least when they are prosecuted for corruption. 
The largest firms is America and Britain together spend more than $15 billion a year on CSR , according to an estimate by EPG,a consulting firm ,This could add value to their businesses in three ways.First, consumers may take CSR spending as a “signal” that a company’s products are of high quality.Second, customers may be willing to buy a company’s products as an indirect way to donate to the good causes is helps. And third, through a more diffuse “halo effect,” whereby its good deeds earn it greater consideration from consumers and others. 
Previous studies on CSR have had trouble differentiating these effects because consumers can be affected by all three. A recent study attempts to separate them by looking at bribery prosecutions under America’s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). It argues that since prosecutors do not consume a company's products as part of their investigations, they could be influenced only by the halo effect. 
The study found that, among prosecuted firms, those with the most comprehensiveCSR programmes tendedto getmore lenient penalties. Their analysis ruled out the possibility that it was firms' political influence, rather than their CSR stand,that accounted for the leniency: Companies that contributed more to political campaigns did not receive lower fines.
In all, the study concludes that whereas prosecutors should only evaluate a case based on its merits, they do seen to influenced by a company’s record in CSR. "We estimate that either eliminating a substantial labour-rights concern, such as child labour, or increasing corporate giving by about 20% results in fines that generally are 40% lower than the typical punishment for bribing foreign officials," says one researcher. 
Researchers admit that their study does not answer the question of how much businesses ought to spend on CSR.

     There will eventually come a day when The New York Times cases to publish stories on newsprint .Exactly when that day will be is a matter of debate. “Sometime in the future “the paper’s publisher said back in 2010. 
     Nostalgia for ink on paper and the rustle of pages aside ,there’s plenty of incentive to ditch print .The infrastructure required to make a physical newspapers -printing presses .delivery truck -isn’t just expensive it’s excessive at a time when online-only competition don’t have the same set financial constraints . Readers are migrating away from print away,And although print ad sales still dwarf their online and mobile counterparts revenue from print is still declining. 
     Overhead may be high and circulation lowe ,but rushing to eliminate its print editor would be a mistake ,says BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti. 
  Peretti says the Times shouldn't waste time getting of the print business, only if they go about doing it the right away “Figuring out a way to accelerate that transition would make sense for them “he said, “but if you discontinue it, you're going to have your most loyal customers really upset with you." Sometimes that's worth making a change anyway". Peretti gives example of Netflix discontinuing its DVD-mailing service to focus on streaming. "It was seen as a blunder." he said. The move turned out to be foresighted. And if Peretti were in charge at the times? "l wouldn't pick year to end print."he said. “I would raise and make it into more of a legacy product.”
The most loyal costumer would still gel the product they favor. the idea goes, and they’d feel like they were helping sustain the quality of something they believe in. "So if you're overpaying for print, you could feel like you were helping," peretti said. "Then increase it at rate each year and essentially try to generate additional revenue." In other words, if you're going to print product, make it for the people who are already obsessed with it. Which may be what the Times is doing already. Getting the print edition seven days a week costs nearly $500 a year ― more than twice as much as a digital-only subscription.   
"It's a really hard thing to do and it's a tremendous luxury that BuzzFeed doesn't have a legacy business," Peretti remarked. "But we're going to have questions like that where we have things we're doing that don't make sense when the market.Change and the world changes. In those situations, it's better to be more aggressive than less aggressive."
36.The New York Times is considering ending its print edition partly due .
[A]the high cost of operation. 
[B]the pressure form its investors.
[C]the complaints form its readers 
[D]the increasing online ad asles. 
37.Peretti suggests that,in face of the present situation,the Times should.  
[A]seek new sources of readership. 
[B]end the print edition for goog. 
[C]aim for efficitent management. 
[D]make strategic adiustments. 
38.It can inferred form Paragraphs 5 and 6 that a “legacy product” .
[A]helps restore the glory of former times. 
[B]is meant for the most loyal customers. 
[C]will have the cost of printing reduced. 
[D]expands the popularity of the paper
39.Peretti believes that,in a changing world, .
[A]legacy businesses are becoming outdated .
[B]cautiousness facilitates problem-solving.
 [C]aggressiveness better meets challenges. 
[D]traditional luxuries can stay unaffected. 
40.Which of the following would be the best title of the text?
[A]Shift to Online Newspapers All at Once 
[B]Cherish the Newspapers Still in Your Hand 
[C]Make Your Print Newspaper a Luxury Good 
[D]Keep Your Newspapers Forever in Fashion

　　Directions:
　　In the following text, some sentences have been removed. For Questions 41-45, choose the most suitable one from the fist A-G to fit into each of the numbered blanks. Mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET. (10 points)
[A]Create a new image of yourself 
[B]Have confidence in yourself  
[C]Decide if the time is right 
[D]Understand the context 
[E]Work with professionals 
[F]Mark it efficient 
[G]Know your goals
No matter how formal orinformal theworkenvironment,the way you present yourself has an impact.This isespecially truein first impressions.According to researchfrom PrincetonUniversity, people assessyour competence,Trustworthiness, and likeability in just a tenth of a second, solelybased ontheway you look. 
  The different between today’sworkplace and the “dress for success”era is that the range of optionsis so muchbroader. Normshaveevolvedandfragmented.In some settings, red sneakers or dress T―shirts can conveystatus;inother not somuch. Plus, whatever  image we present is magnified by social―media services  like LinkedIn.Chances are, your headshots are seen much more often now than adecade or two ago.Millennials, it seems, face the paradox of being the least formal generation yet the most conscious of style and personal branding.It can beconfusing. 
  So how do we navigate this?How do we know when to invest in anupgrade?And what’s the best way to pull off  one  that enhances our goals？Here are some  tips: 
41.	

As an executive coach, I’ve  seen  image   upgrades   be   particularlyhelpfulduring  transitions―when looking  for a new  job ,  stepping  into  a  new  or  morepublic role ,or changing  work  environments. If you’re in a period of change or just feeling stuck and in a rut, now may be a good time. If you’re not sure, ask forhonest feedback  from trusted friends, colleagues and professionals .Look for cues 
about how others perceive you. Maybe there’s no need for an upgrade and that’s OK. 
42.	

Get clear on what impact you’re hoping to have. Are you looking to refresh your image or pivot it? For one person, the goal may be to be taken more seriously and enhance their professional image. For another, it may be to be perceived as moreapproachable, or more modern and stylish. For someone moving from finance to advertising, maybe they want to look ore “SoHo.” (It’s OK to use characterizations like that.) 
43.	

Look at your work environment like an anthropologist. What are the norms of your environment? What conveys status? Who are your most important audience? How do the people you respect and look up to prevent themselves? The better you understand the cultural context, the more control you can have over your impact.
44.	

Enlist the support of professionals and share with them your goals and context. Hire a personal stylist, or use the free styling service of a store like Crew. Try a hair stylist instead of a barber. Work with a professional photographer instead of your spouse of friend. It’s not as expensive as you might think. 
45.	

The point of a style upgrade isn’t to become more vain or to spend more time discussing over what to wear. Instead, use it as an opportunity to reduce decision fatigue. Pick a standard work uniform or a few go-to opinions. Buy all your clothes once with a stylist instead of shopping alone, one article of clothing a time.

Read the following text carefully and then translate the underlined segments into Chinese. Your translation should be written neatly on the ANSWER SHEET. (10 pionts) 
Mental health is our birthright. (46) We don’t have to learn how to be mentally healthy; it is built into us in the same way that our bodies know how to heal a cut or mend a broken bone. Mental health can't be learned, only reawakened. It is like the immune system of the body, which under stress or through lack of nutrition or exercise can be weakened, but which never leaves us. When we don't understand the value of mental health and we don't know how to gain access to it, mental health will remain hidden from us. (47) Our mental health doesn’t really go anywhere; like the sun behind a cloud. it can be temporarily hidden from view, but it is fully capable of being restored in an instant. 
Mental health is the seed that contains self-esteem ― confidence in ourselves and an ability to trust in our common sense. It allows us to have perspective on our lives ― the ability to not take ourselves too seriously, to laugh at ourselves, to see the bigger picture, and to see that things will work out. It's a form of innate or unlearned optimism. (48) Mental health allows us to view others with sympathy if they are having troubles with kindness if they are in pain and with unconditional love no matter who they are. Mental health is the source of creativity for solving problems, resolving conflict, making our surroundings more beautiful, managing our home life, or coming up with a creative business idea or invention to make our lives easier. It gives us patience for ourselves and toward others as well as patience while driving, catching a fish, working on our car. or raising a child. It allows us to see the beauty that surrounds us each moment in nature, in culture, in the flow of our daily lives. 
(49)Although mental health is the cure-all for living our lives, it is perfectly ordinary as you will see that it has been there to direct you through all your difficult decisions. It has been available even in the most mundane of life situations to show you right from wrong, good from bad, friend from foe. Mental health has commonly been called conscience, instinct, wisdom, common sense, or the inner voice. We think of it simply as a healthy and helpful flow of intelligent thought. (50) As you will come to see, knowing that mental health is always available and knowing to trust it allow us to slow down to the moment and live life happily.

2016年考研英语真题答案解析
Section I: Use of English(10 points)
1、【答案】 [D]as well as
　【考点分析】本题考察逻辑关系
　【解析】因为考察逻辑关系，所以需要我们先对填空前后的原文信息做定位分析：文章身处大环境not only…but also之中，这是一个明显的并列关系，表示“不仅……而且……”该空与前一句“his parents and his friends”也是并列关系，表示“与他本人以及伴侣的父母朋友相关”所以答案只能是D.as well as。
A.by way of通过   B.with regard to 关于  C.on behalf of 代表
2、【答案】 [A] decide on
　【考点分析】上下文语义
　【解析】根据该句的主语a young man与宾语a likely spouse的关系，答案只能是A. decide on 决定，表示自己决定自己的对象。B.provide for 为……提供准备 C.compete with与……竞争 D.adapt to适用
3、【答案】[B]arrange
　【考点分析】上下文语义及动词辨析
　【解析】该句意思为，他可以自己选择自己中意的伴侣并让父母___相关事务。四个选项中，A.close 关闭 C.renew 更新；恢复 D.postpone“推迟”，语义不正确，只有B.arrange安排是符合语境。
4、【答案】 [A]In theory
　【考点分析】上下文语义
　【解析】逻辑判断题。主要是看前后两句的含义，前面是说“他可以自己选择自己中意的伴侣并让父母安排相关事务，或者几乎不参与，完全让父母选择自己的对象。”空格后面说“女方可以拒绝她父母所选择的对象。”这两句之间没有举例说明的关系，且有一个may，更证明A.In theory的正确性。而其他选项 B.Above all最重要的是 C.In time 准时 D.For example举例，均不符合题意。
5、【答案】 [C]After
　【考点分析】上下文语义
　【解析】根据下文“____a spouse has been selected， each family investigates the other……”知道，只有对象选择好后，父母才会去调查研究对方的背景。所以只有after才对。其他选项A.Unless 除非，否则 B.Lest 以免，唯恐 D.Although 尽管都不符合题意。
6、【答案】[A]into
　【考点分析】上下文语义及介词词义辨析
　【解析】这里主要是看marry与相关介词的固定搭配。这里marry into就是指嫁到，而其他选项均没有这层含义。
7、【答案】 [C]but
　【考点分析】逻辑关系题
　【解析】根据上文，说传统的婚礼时间跨度很长，但是到了1980s，婚礼只持续一天半。所以与前文发生转变。因此要选择but转折关系。
8、【答案】 [C]recite
　【考点分析】上下文语义及动词词义辨析
　【解析】空格处需要填一个动词，和后面的prayers of blessing所搭配，C选项recite 为背诵的意思，与所给短语搭配最为合理，译为“为祈祷者做祈福”。
9、【答案】 [D]tying
　【考点分析】上下文语义及动词词义辨析
　【解析】本题需要根据上下文语义分析，空格处需要搭配后文“棉花线头”，纵观四个选项[A]折叠[B]堆积 [C]包裹 [D]系上，根据选项含义，只有D和后文的“棉花线头”搭配最为合理。
10、【答案】[A]passing
　【考点分析】上下文语义及动词词义辨析
　【解析】本题根据选项[A]传递[B]点亮 [C]隐藏 [D]服务，原文空格需要填写一个动词与后文“around a circle”来搭配，译为“将蜡烛传一圈”，故[A]传递为正确选项。
11、【答案】 [D]union
　【考点分析】名词词义辨析
　【解析】本题根据选项[A]协会，社团[B]会议，会面 [C]集合 [D]结合。本句语义为“这些受尊敬的夫妻祈祷…”根据语境，结婚是一种夫妻二人的结合，因此，选项[D]结合更符合语境。
12、【答案】 [D]live
　【考点分析】上下文语义及动词词义辨析
【解析】本题比较简单。根据语义“根据传统，新婚夫妇要搬到妻子父母家，与父母__一年”根据语境，应为[D]居住为最佳答案。
13、【答案】 [B]until
　【考点分析】时间逻辑关系
　【解析】根据原文，“____他们在附近建造一栋新房子” [A]然而[B]直到 [C]为 [D]如果结合语境，[B]直到最符合原文语境，搭配最为合理。
14、【答案】 [D]obtain
　【考点分析】上下文语义及动词词义辨析
　【解析】Divorce is legal and relatively easy to __14__，but not common。该句句意为离婚是合法的，且相对容易____。A.avoid 避免B.follow 跟随C.chanllenge挑战，质疑D.obtain获得。这里出现and，所以对于离婚这件事不可能是避免或是挑战，但是跟随和离婚之间语义不符，但是获得离婚（的批准）是可以的。选D。
15、【答案】 [D] viewed
　【考点分析】上下文语义及动词词义辨析
　【解析】 Divorced persons are __15__ with some disapproval。离婚的人…一些不赞同。在段首，已经注明离婚是合法的且相对容易得到批准，但是不常见。这说明离婚在现实中肯定是不太受到人们的欢迎的。而接下来这句就说离婚的人…一些不赞同。再看选项：A.isolated孤立 B.persuaded劝说C.viewed看做 D.exposed接触，受到…的影响C选项固定搭配被认为，放进。
16、【答案】[B]whatever
　【考点分析】语法
　【解析】Each spouse retains __16__ property he or she _17_ into the marriage，17个空对应的都是动词，所以该句意思为：夫妇双方保有…财产，这个财产是他或她…（动词）进婚姻的。结合选项A.whenever“无论何地；任何（地方）=any place where（定从）”。B.whatever“无论什么；任何（东西）=anything that/any+N that”。C.whenever无论何时；任何（时间=any time when）D.however 无论如何；无论多么。根据语义，这里应该不是让步的关系，而且填的这个词还要能修饰property。因此，选择B =retains any property that he or she …。
17、【答案】 [B]brought
　【考点分析】上下文语义及动词义辨析
　【解析】 Each spouse retains __16__property he or she _17_ into the marriage，结合选项A changed“改变”。B.brought “带来”。C.shaped“形成” D.pushed“推，逼迫”。结合语境只有B符合，把财产带入婚姻。

　【解析】…and jointly-acquired property is _18_equally。结合选项A.invested投资。B.divided平分C.donated 捐赠D.withdrawn撤出，提取。根据语义应该是共同财产被（夫妻双方）平分。
19、【答案】 [C]shows
　【考点分析】动词固定搭配
　【解析】 Divorced persons may remarry， but a gender prejudice _19_up。该句语义为离过婚的人或许会再婚，但是性别偏见…。结合选项A.warm（up）加热 B.clear（up）变晴C.show （up）显现D.break（up）分裂，分开；显然C是正确选项。
20、【答案】 [A]while
　【选项分析】上下文语义
　【解析】很明显的两类人的对比比较关系。只能选择while。
　　
【真题翻译】在柬埔寨，伴侣的选择对于年轻男性来说是一个复杂的问题。这不仅与他本人以及未来伴侣的父母朋友相关，而且与媒婆也有着千丝万缕的关系。他可以自己选择自己中意的伴侣并让父母安排相关事务，或者几乎不参与，完全让父母选择自己的对象。理论上来说，女方可以拒绝她父母所选择的对象。在选好自己的对象后，每个家庭都能会去调查对方家庭来确保他们的孩子嫁到好人家。
传统的婚礼是一段漫长，多姿多彩的过程。从前会持续三天，但是到了20世纪80年代，一般会持续一天半。佛教徒通常会做简短诵经，并为新人祈福。仪式通常包括剪发，在新郎新娘的胳膊上系上浸满圣水的棉绳，在幸福的、受人尊敬的夫妇中传递蜡烛来祈祷新人的结合。通常情况下，新婚夫妇会到妻子父母家里住一年，直到他们在附近建一栋新房子为止。
离婚是合法的，而且很容易获得批准，但是在实际中这种情况并不常见。离过婚的男女会受到一些人的诟病。夫妇双方在离婚后可保有他或她婚前带来的财产，而且可平分婚后共同取得的财产。离过婚的人或许会再婚，但是性别偏见还是很明显。比如，离过婚的男性再婚前不需要一段等待期而女性则需要等待十个月。

Section II Reading Comprehension
　 Part A
　　Text 1
21、【答案】A Physical beauty would be redefined
　  【解析】这是一道细节题，根据France定位到第一段第一句，主干成分为France has lost an absolute right to define physical beauty。此外第二段第二句They suggest beauty should not be define by looks…故而A physical beauty would be redefined为同义替换，即为正确答案。
22、【答案】 D doing harm to
　【解析】此题为词义题。定位到第二段第二句They suggest beauty should not be defined by looks that end up impinging on health。根据end up可以看出beauty should not be defined by looks 和that end up impinging on health为顺承关系，所以“改变人们对美不仅仅是外表的定义”可以结束对健康的危害。故而可以推知doing harm to是正确答案。
23、【答案】B. New Standards are being set in Denmark
　　【解析】此题是正误判断题。根据第五段第二句话 In Denmark，…it is trying to set voluntary standards for models and fashion…可知B选项 New standards are being set in Denmark是其同义替换。
24、【答案】C showing little concern for health factors
　【解析】细节题。一个设计师很可能因为什么原因被CFW拒绝，根据关键词可回到文中定位至倒数第二段，首句说丹麦的时尚界就有关模特的年龄，健康及其他特性的内容达成一致意见，切一项新法案也明确规定，他们已经意识到时尚界对于人们尤其是年轻人的身体健康所带来的影响，并且该对此负责，接着下一句就说，这一法规的执行方式就是拒绝一些设计师，因为可以推断设计师很可能因为不考虑身体健康因素而被CFW拒绝。
25、【答案】D. A challenge to the Fashion Industry’s Body Ideals
　　【解析】主旨题。本文从首段就开始阐述法国的观点，即时尚界已经失去了定义女性身体之美的权利，且议会也禁止网站通过宣传过度节食来强调过度消瘦。二段继续说明美丽不能只看外表更不能以牺牲健康为代价。三段说女性不该让他人来评判自己的美丽。以及后面的段落中也一直在不断说明一点，即健康很重要，不能只看外表。所以文章最佳标题应该是D，对时尚界完美身材的质疑。

Text 2
26、【答案】D. is not well reflected in politics
　【解析】细节题。精读题干，划出关键词。根据题干回到原文精确定位到首段最后一句，该句中的polls民意调查对应题干中的public sentiment，定位答案处为“this has limited political support”，意思为这在政治支持方面是有限的。与D选项“在政治上没有得到很好的反响”为同义替换。
27、【答案】D. largely overshadowed
　【解析】细节题。根据题干，题干中出现大写the National Trust，定位到第二段首句the National Trust该句。二段首句只是对Hill的该项目做介绍，需向后看影响。往下可以读到Hill’s pressure这句，写到“Hill的项目创造出国家公园和绿地。他们不再制造乡村了，而且每年钢筋混凝土消耗的乡村越来越多。乡村需要持久的保护”。对应选项，该项目的成就很大程度上被夺取了光辉。
28、【答案】A. Ukip may gain from its support for rural conservation
　　【解析】推断题。题干问的是从第三段能推出什么，考察的是相应段落的段落中心。观察选项不难发现，选项中都是大写的Ukip，The Conservatives，The Liberal Democrats，Labour。可根据选项中的大写回段落中寻找，发现Ukip所在的定位句为Only的倒装强调句（倒装强调句往往为答案所在处）。该句子意思是：只有Ukip意识到其机会，并支持这些人。和选项A对应一下，Ukip可能能从其对农村保护的支持中获得好处，是同义替换。
29、【答案】B. Shows his disregard for the character of rural areas
　【解析】细节题问的是作者对于奥斯本的偏好（观点）的具体看法。根据关键词奥斯本定位至第五段，因为问的是作者对于奥斯本观点的看法，所以只需要看在奥斯本的观点之后作者的表达内容，第五段倒数两句话就是作者表达自己观点的地方，即“我们没有破坏城市中受到保护的地方”，“你们为什么要破坏乡村的呢？”这就说明奥斯本一方的观点是要破坏乡村环境。所以可得出答案是奥斯本想法表明了他对于乡村人们的忽视。
30、【答案】C. the-town-and-country planning in Britain
　　【解析】根据题干定位到最后一段，问的是作者欣赏赞同什么，作者的观点即是文章末段的段落中心，可定位到末段末句。末句指出，避免this会将左右党派联系起来，this代词指代指代上句中所提到的内容。Should即作者赞同的地方，也就是作者赞同的是城乡结合。

Text 3
31、【答案】B. Skepticism
　　【解析】作者观点态度题。题干问的是作者对有关CSR方面Milton Friedman的说法是什么态度。根据大写Milton Friedman这个人定位到定位到首段首句。注意题干问的是作者的看法，因此定位到后一句but转折处。转折处的主题句式“things may not absolutely clear-cut”，作者持的是否定态度，选择答案B。C选项是作者态度不明确，不能选择。
32、【答案】 A winning trust from consumers
　　【解析】根据题干找到第二段。根据第二段内容，CSR could add value to their business in three ways。从而定位下面三点。First后面出现了high quality，但是它是在从句中，从句修饰“signal”，而本句谓语动词是take，与D中 raising 并不是同义词，故排除。Second，和third 都与消费者购买心态有关，和A选项 winning trust from consumers 相对应。而B，C选项的malpractices和defamed在原文中并未出现，且没有同义词，故排除。
33、【答案】 C less severe
　【解析】根据题干找到第四段对应处。可见题干的 more lenient 是作为修饰 penalties（惩罚）的，故推测本句在讨论 CSR 和 penalties 有什么联系。而本段与惩罚相关的词只有最后一个词 fines（罚金），修饰它的形容词是lower，故可推测 more lenient 与降低惩罚有关，只有C选项满足。
34、【答案】A. has an impact on their decision
　　【解析】题干中问的是 CSR record 与 prosecutors evaluate a case 的关系，根据题干内容到对应点：第五段第一句。本句说，。。。they do seem to be influenced by a company‘s recore in CSR。这里的 be influenced 与A选项 has an impact 对应，故选A。而B选项中的 reliable evidence， C 选项中的 the chance of being penalized 在原文中没有体现。D选项中的 investigation 与题干中的 When prosecutors evaluate a case 明显对应不上，故不予考虑。
35、【答案】B. The necessary amount of companies’ spending on it is unknown
　　【解析】该题是一道判断题，题干问的是有关CSR哪个是对的。先根据CSR回到最后一段，定位到末段首句。首句提到“研究人员承认到其研究没有回答如下问题：公司应该在CSR方面花费多少钱”。选项B的意思是公司在其方面的花费是未知的，属于原文的同义替换。

Text 4
36、【答案】C. the high cost of operation
　　【解析】因果细节题，问的是纽约时报考虑停止纸质版新闻印刷出版的原因是什么。文章首段首句即是此内容的同义表达，二段解释具体原因，二段二句内容 The infrastructure isn‘t just expensive； it’s excessive at a time when online-only competitors don‘t have the same set of financial constraints。意思是维持纸质印刷的基础设施建设不仅仅是贵，是相当贵，而他们的竞争对手却没有这样的经济上的限制。
37、【答案】A make strategic adjustments
　　【解析】细节题，问的是面对目前的形势，Peretti建议时代杂志怎么做，根据关键词Peretti回文定位至第四段，首句内容是Peretti说时代杂志不该浪费时间去想着如何停止纸质印刷，而应该找到一种正确的方法去解决这件事。接着二句往后在具体说明该如何正确解决目前的问题。由此推出答案是A 做出策略上的调整。
38、【答案】 B is meant for the most loyal customers
　　【解析】推断题与词汇题的结合，要根据上下文来做出选择。首先定位在第五段最后一句：I would raise prices and make it into more of a legacy product。不仅要提高价格还要将它变为一种可以传承的产物。单单这一句不足以做出选择。需要继续往下看在第六段中有没有对于这个词的解释之类的。第六段开头提到了他认为most consumer 依旧坚持去相信他们认为好的东西，喜欢的，相信的东西。如果可以每年增加一些比例，那么依旧是可以创收的。长篇大段的叙述可以让大家明白这个词一定跟consumer有关。最为关键的是：紧接着出现了 in  other world，重述上文，不过却简洁的总结了前文。如果我们要做这些print product，那就选择那些已经痴迷于他们的人吧。（那么对于他们来讲就是一件可以传承的东西了，以前喜欢，会依旧喜欢下去）。所以这句为做题的关键，对应同义替换，选择B。A选项中的降低成本没有在文中相应位置涉及到。 C重建以往的关荣，与消费者关系不大 D扩大受欢迎程度，范围过大。
39、【答案】B aggressiveness better meets challenges
　【解析】观点态度题。偏细节题。定位Peretti在文中的观点，首次出现在第三段 overhead…but rushing to eliminate its print edition would be a mistake。并且一直贯穿于下文。我们首先从选项来看。A 中…can stay unaffected 过于绝对，不选。D 选项中legacy business 不是文中的讨论话题，所以可以直接排除。而C选项中谨慎可以促进问题的解决，在perreti的观点中根本没有体现，相反他建议要有所改变，并且要找对方式，言下之意就是大胆去面对挑战。所以最终确定是B。
40、【答案】A Make Your Print Newspaper a Luxury Good
　　【解析】主旨题。出现在最后一道题目中，全文共有7段，根据上面的细节题目，大致可以确定本文的中心词为“print newspaper”B，C 两个选项中的newspaper 都属于范围过大，是主旨题的典型错误选项，而D选项中出现的online newspaper 只是文中print newspaper时提到的一个面临的一个挑战，不足以引领全文，并且all at once，是“立刻，马上”之意，与原文的观点也有出入，最终确定选A。

Part B
41、【答案】 B Decide if the time is right
　【解析】此段第一句话主句里面说“在过渡的阶段提升自我形象尤其有用”。第二句和第三、四句分别展开说明，第二句表明：如果你处在变动的时期或者感觉需要变动，那么可能这可能是一个好的时机。相反，第三、四句话表示：如果不确定的话，就需要得到别人的反馈了。也许无需提升。故整段的意思是说要先确定是否现在是提升自我形象的正确时机。故答案为C选项。
42、【答案】F Know your goals
　【解析】此段中心句即第一句话，标明“要清楚你想要的结果或影响”。其实就是你想要的目标。紧接着开始解释，提到比如，你是否想要更新你的形象？那么，对于一个人来讲，这个目标可能是要被认真对待或者要加强专业的形象。对于其他人，这个目标可能是要被看作可以触摸到的，或者是现代的，或者是时尚的。对于那些要从金融转到广告的，他们可能得看起来更“SOHO”。所以，整段都在讲目标。而选项F中的”goal”形成复现。故为答案。
43、【答案】D Understand the context
　【解析】复现原则，文章多次重复environment， understand the context 就是要理解你的工作处境。
44、【答案】E Work with professionals
　【解析】复现原则，文章多次重复professional， work with，就是要与专业人士一起工作。
45、【答案】G Make it efficient
　【解析】此段第二句句首出现instead，故为转折句。所以从此句获得中心内容。该句讲的是“最好是将形象升级用做减少做决定的机会。”紧接着提到“选取一套标准的工作服或几个其他的选择。把衣服一下子都买了，而不是一个人购买，或者一次只买一件”。这些提到的都是要有效率。故选G。

46、We don’t have to learn how to be mentally healthy； it is built into us in the same way that our bodies know how to heal a cut or mend a broken bone。
　【句子结构】分号连接的两个并列句，第一个并列句主干是 We don’t have to learn ，how引导宾语从句做learn的宾语，第二个并列句主干是it is built into us in the same way，that引导定语从句修饰先行词way，that定语从句中主干是our bodies know，how引导宾语从句做know的宾语。
　【参考译文】我们无需刻意去了解学习才能让心理更健康，它正如我们的身体知道怎样让伤口愈合和修复骨折一样，是根植于我们体内的/是我们与生俱来的能力。
47 、Our mental health doesn’t really go anywhere； like the sun behind a cloud， it can be temporarily hidden from view， but it is fully capable of being restored in an instant。
　【句子结构】分号连接的两个并列句，第一个并列句主谓结构，很简单，第二个并列句中，like the sun behind a cloud是状语，but 连接两个并列分句，包括短语be hidden from 和be capable of。涉及被动语态的翻译方法。
　【参考译文】我们的心理健康并不是真的消失不见，就像云朵背后的太阳，它也许暂时被遮挡，但是它也可以在瞬间重焕光芒。
48、Mental health allows us to view others with sympathy if they are having troubles， with kindness if they are in pain， and with unconditional love no matter who they are。
　【句子结构】句子主干是 Mental health allows us to view others，三个并列with 引导的介词短语做状语，前两个with引导的状语中各包含一个if引导的条件状从，最后一个with状语中包含一个no matter 引导的让步状语。
　【参考译文】心理健康使我们在他人遇到麻烦时给予同情，在他人痛苦时心存善意，而且无论对方是谁都会给予无条件的关爱。
49、【参考译文】尽管拥有健康的心智是我们生活中的万能药，但它并不稀奇，你会发现在你难以做决定时，它一直在指引着你。
　　【句子结构】本题有一个由although引导的让步状语从句，as引导的时间状语从句，以及that引导的宾语从句构成。此处“mental health”若是翻译成心理健康与下文连接，则不符合中文表达习惯，又因mental本身与智力相关，所以将其翻译成“健康的心智”；此外“perfectly ordinary”可以正译，译为“非常普遍”，本译文采取正话反说的方式，译为“并不稀奇”。再次，“difficult decisions”若翻译为困难的决定，不符合中文的表达方式，所以将decision，名词译为动词“做决定”。
50、As you will come to see， knowing that mental health is always available and knowing to trust it allow us slow down to the moment and live life happily。
　　【参考译文】你会慢慢理解到，健康的心智会一直存在，坚信这一点，此刻我们就可以放慢生活节奏，快乐的生活。
　　【句子结构】本题由as 引导的时间状语从句，that引导的宾语从句组成，并且考察代词“it”。“see”在此时了解而不是看到的意思，意思和knowing一致，随意合并翻译；“available”本意“可得到的”，句中意译为“一直存在”。

Notice
　　August 20， 2015
　　To ensure students from oversea to be acquainted with the service of library in Beijing University， we write this notice to inform you of some relevant information about our library。
　　To begin with， our library provides a large amount of books and materials covering not only most majors and subjects， but also many extra-curricular reading materials， thus satisfying all your reading requirements。 Furthermore， the library opens during the week time， each day from 9：00 am to10：00pm.Last but not least， only students enrolled in this university and with a special Library Card are allowed to enter into our library。
　　Anyone interested in studying or reading in our library should sign up their name with their monitor before August 31， and the Library Card will be issued within a week。
　　Library of Beijing University
　　
解析：今年英语一的小作文与我们预测的完全一致，再一次考查到了通知。在英语一的考试当中，通知已经考查过1年。例如我们英语一在2010年就考查过代表研究生会写一篇招募国际会议的通知。同时英语二在2015年考的也是招募志愿者的通知。我们在课堂上也反复强调过通知的格式，所以同学们对此应该毫无压力。
　　同时以图书馆为写作背景，在2007年的建议信中也已经考察过，所以相关表达在课堂上都已经涉及过。因此，只要把2010年通知的格式，结合2007年建议信的相关内容，就可以很轻松的写出2016年的小作文。这就启发我们2017届的同学们要高度重视历年真题，因为考过的话题或是书信类型会反复考查。
　　下面我们来详细解读下今年的小作文，首先看一下题目要求：
　　Suppose you are a librarian in your university。 Write a notice of about 100 words， providing the newly-enrolled international students with relevant information about the library。
　　小作文即A 节作文的评分侧重点在于1。格式和语域的恰当；2。信息点的覆盖、3。内容的组织、4。语言的准确性。那么我们主要从格式和内容两方面来解析此文。
　　首先，从格式上来说，通知的格式包括四大部分：
　　1。标题，通知要求必须有标题，可以直接用Notice 做标题就可以，注意首字母大写，居中
　　2。时间，通知的时间要求在标题下方第二行，按照日月年的顺序来写，注意月与年之间要有逗号，且时间在靠右对齐
　　3。正文，通知正文要求首段缩进四个字符，不要求一定分段，为了内容层次清晰，建议分三段为好。
　　4。落款，落款即发通知的单位，此处需要特别注意，根据题目的要求，你是代表图书馆写的通知，所以落款应该是某某图书馆，而非Li Ming 本人。
　　另外，从内容上来看，作文一个图书管理员，要向学生介绍学校的图书馆，其实可以介绍的内容还是很多的，比如图书馆的藏书，图书馆的开放时间，入馆要求等等。所以内容部分对于大家来书应该也不是难事，具体内容可以参考如上范文。

52、
【参考范文】
What is symbolically depicted in the caricatures， there emerge two circumstances， carrying sharp contrast implications。 In the first drawing， a father is watching a football match on the sofa who is at the same time supervising his son to finish homework。 It is not difficult to observe that his son wears frowned expression on his face。 On the contrary， the second portrayal depicts a father is working just besides his son， who is doing his assignment。
　　The objective of the drawer is to demonstrate that utmost significance should be attached to the phenomenon that setting proper examples has exerted great impact on the growth of the younger generation in China at present。 Previously， it is widely acknowledged that it is the compelling obligation for the parents to help their kids to form an appropriate value about the world and the life， which carries overwhelmingly precious connotation to the sound development on the younger generation。 Simultaneously， there is no denying that the most rational method for adults to educate their adolescents is to set themselves a good example to their teenagers rather than making perpetual requirements， which is less persuasive compared with the actions。
　　Accordingly， it is vital for us to derive positive implication from these thought-provoking drawings。 On the one hand， we can frequently use them to enlighten the parents to be more advisable in educate their children。 On the other hand， parents should attach more emphasis on setting excellent models for their juveniles。 Only by doing so， can we effectively ensure a promising prospect for the adolescents。

解析：
2015年的大作文从总体上来看不难，因为它考查到了现在的一个社会热点。这个热点甚至比2014年当时的热点还要热！就内容和话题而言，在我们的预料之中，属于综合性话题，既考察了当今信息社会发展过程中网络对我们生活的影响，正如任何事物有两个方面一样，积极方面和消极方面，必须做到两者的统一，对于手机的影响这个话题大家应该是有话可说的。同时，本题也考查了人际关系方面的内容，同样是两方面内容所引申出来的，这是借用人际关系这个事件来说明和阐述手机的两方面的影响和作用，也就是手机的出现和发展给我们之间的联系提供了方便，使我们的世界变成了地球村，另外比如信息共享，成果共享等都非常方便；除此之外，也有消极的一方面，也就是手机的出现同时淡漠了人际关系，忽视了人与人之间的面对面的交往和联系，同时人们之间面对面说话的交流机会少了，话题也少了。最后说出你的对策。
更重要的是：从十年的考研真题来讲，2009年的大作文考查到了网络的问题，当年的图画是很多人在一个类似大的蜘蛛网的区域里上网，图片下面有一行字：网络的“近”与“远”！当年的描述图画部分比较难表达，而今年图画描述部分相比起来就容易得多。下面我们就从写作的标准三段式来讲讲这三段我们应该怎么写。
第一段图画描述段的写作内容主要是表述图画，四个人都在盯着手机，桌子上的饭菜没动，还可以更加注意写细节，比如他们认真的神情和桌子上的饭菜未动之类！第二段是图画涵义阐释段。本段可分两个方面来具体写。一方面具体写明手机给我们带来的好处；另一方面，我们要指出手机的弊端，给我们生活带来了很多负面影响。第三段评论段的写作内容为给出自己的评论和建议。可以指出年轻人应该重视面对面的交流！最后一句可以展望一下未来，说如果我们放下手机拿起筷子享受美食，和谐的关系就会出现了！
如果同学们指出这个是一个社会问题，我们要加以改正，个人认为这也是可以接受的！

　Text 1
　　King Juan Carlos of Spain once insisted “kings don’t abdicate, they dare in their sleep.” But embarrassing scandals and the popularity of the republican left in the recent Euro-elections have forced him to eat his words and stand down. So, does the Spanish crisis suggest that monarchy is seeing its last days? Does that mean the writing is on the wall for all European royals, with their magnificent uniforms and majestic lifestyle?
　　The Spanish case provides arguments both for and against monarchy. When public opinion is particularly polarised, as it was following the end of the Franco regime, monarchs can rise above “mere” politics and “embody” a spirit of national unity.
　　It is this apparent transcendence of politics that explains monarchs’ continuing popularity polarized. And also, the Middle East excepted, Europe is the most monarch-infested region in the world, with 10 kingdoms (not counting Vatican City and Andorra). But unlike their absolutist counterparts in the Gulf and Asia, most royal families have survived because they allow voters to avoid the difficult search for a non-controversial but respected public figure.
　　Even so, kings and queens undoubtedly have a downside. Symbolic of national unity as they claim to be, their very history―and sometimes the way they behave today C embodies outdated and indefensible privileges and inequalities. At a time when Thomas Piketty and other economists are warning of rising inequality and the increasing power of inherited wealth, it is bizarre that wealthy aristocratic families should still be the symbolic heart of modern democratic states.
　　The most successful monarchies strive to abandon or hide their old aristocratic ways. Princes and princesses have day-jobs and ride bicycles, not horses (or helicopters). Even so, these are wealthy families who party with the international 1%, and media intrusiveness makes it increasingly difficult to maintain the right image.
　　While Europe’s monarchies will no doubt be smart enough to survive for some time to come, it is the British royals who have most to fear from the Spanish example.
　　It is only the Queen who has preserved the monarchy’s reputation with her rather ordinary (if well-heeled) granny style. The danger will come with Charles, who has both an expensive taste of lifestyle and a pretty hierarchical view of the world. He has failed to understand that monarchies have largely survived because they provide a service C as non-controversial and non-political heads of state. Charles ought to know that as English history shows, it is kings, not republicans, who are the monarchy’s worst enemies.
　　21.  According to the first two Paragraphs, King Juan Carlos of Spain
　　[A] used turn enjoy high public support
　　[B] was unpopular among European royals
　　[C] cased his relationship with his rivals
　　[D]ended his reign in embarrassment
　　22. Monarchs are kept as heads of state in Europe mostly
　　[A] owing to their undoubted and respectable status
　　[B] to achieve a balance between tradition and reality
　　[C] to give voter more public figures to look up to
　　[D]due to their everlasting political embodiment
　　23. Which of the following is shown to be odd, according to Paragraph 4?
　　[A] Aristocrats’ excessive reliance on inherited wealth
　　[B] The role of the nobility in modern democracies
　　[C] The simple lifestyle of the aristocratic families
　　[D]The nobility’s adherence to their privileges
　　24. The British royals “have most to fear” because Charles
　　[A] takes a rough line on political issues
　　[B] fails to change his lifestyle as advised
　　[C] takes republicans as his potential allies
　　[D] fails to adapt himself to his future role
　　25. Which of the following is the best title of the text?
　　[A] Carlos, Glory and Disgrace Combined
　　[B] Charles, Anxious to Succeed to the Throne
　　[C] Carlos, a Lesson for All European Monarchs
　　[D]Charles, Slow to React to the Coming Threats

　　Just how much does the Constitution protect your digital data? The Supreme Court will now consider whether police can search the contents of a mobile phone without a warrant if the phone is on or around a person during an arrest.
　　California has asked the justices to refrain from a sweeping ruling particularly one that upsets the old assumption that authorities may search through the possessions of suspects at the time of their arrest. It is hard, the state argues, for judges to assess the implications of new and rapidly changing technologies.
　　The court would be recklessly modest if it followed California’s advice. Enough of the implications are discernable, even obvious, so that the justices can and should provide updated guidelines to police, lawyers and defendants.
　　They should start by discarding California’s lame argument that exploring the contents of a smart phone ― a vast storehouse of digital information ― is similar to, say, rifling through a suspect’s purse. The court has ruled that police don’t violate the Fourth Amendment when they sift through the wallet or pocketbook of an arrestee without a warrant. But exploring one’s smart phone is more like entering his or her home. A smart phone may contain an arrestee’s reading history, financial history, medical history and comprehensive records of recent correspondence. The development of “cloud computing,” meanwhile, has made that exploration so much the easier.
　　Americans should take steps to protect their digital privacy. But keeping sensitive information on these devices is increasingly a requirement of normal life. Citizens still have a right to expect private documents to remain private and protected by the Constitution’s prohibition on unreasonable searches.
　　As so often is the case, stating that principle doesn’t ease the challenge of line-drawing. In many cases, it would not be overly onerous for authorities to obtain a warrant to search through phone contents. They could still invalidate Fourth Amendment protections when facing severe, urgent circumstances, and they could take reasonable measures to ensure that phone data are not erased or altered while a warrant is pending. The court, though, may want to allow room for police to cite situations where they are entitled to more freedom.
　　But the justices should not swallow California’s argument whole. New, disruptive technology sometimes demands novel applications of the Constitution’s protections. Orin Kerr, a law professor, compares the explosion and accessibility of digital information in the 21st century with the establishment of automobile use as a virtual necessity of life in the 20th: The justices had to specify novel rules for the new personal domain of the passenger car then; they must sort out how the Fourth Amendment applies to digital information now.
　　26.  The Supreme Court will work out whether, during an arrest, it is legitimate to
　　[A] prevent suspects from deleting their phone contents.
　　[B] search for suspects’ mobile phones without a warrant.
　　[C] check suspects’ phone contents without being authorized.
　　[D]prohibit suspects from using their mobile phones.
　　27.  The author’s attitude toward California’s argument is one of
　　[A] disapproval.
　　[B] indifference.
　　[C] tolerance.
　　[D]cautiousness.
　　28.  The author believes that exploring one’s phone contents is comparable to
　　[A] getting into one’s residence.
　　[B] handling one’s historical records.
　　[C] scanning one’s correspondences.
　　[D] going through one’s wallet.
　　29. The author believes that exploring one’s phone contents is comparable to
　　[A] principles are hard to be clearly expressed.
　　[B] the court is giving police less room for action.
　　[C] citizens’ privacy is not effectively protected.
　　[D] phones are used to store sensitive information.
　　30.  Orin Kerr’s comparison is quoted to indicate that
　　[A] the Constitution should be implemented flexibly.
　　[B] new technology requires reinterpretation of the Constitution.
　　[C]California’s argument violates principles of the Constitution.
　　[D]principles of the Constitution should never be altered

　　The journal Science is adding an extra round of statistical checks to its peer-review process, editor-in-chief Marcia McNutt announced today. The policy follows similar efforts from other journals, after widespread concern that basic mistakes in data analysis are contributing to the irreproducibility of many published research findings.
　　“Readers must have confidence in the conclusions published in our journal,” writes McNutt in an editorial. Working with the American Statistical Association, the journal has appointed seven experts to a statistics board of reviewing editors(SBoRE). Manuscript will be flagged up for additional scrutiny by the journal’s internal editors, or by its existing Board of Reviewing Editors or by outside peer reviewers. The SBoRE panel will then find external statisticians to review these manuscripts.
　　Asked whether any particular papers had impelled the change, McNutt said: “The creation of the ‘statistics board’ was motivated by concerns broadly with the application of statistics and data analysis in scientific research and is part of?Science’s overall drive to increase reproducibility in the research we publish.”
　　Giovanni Parmigiani, a biostatistician at the Harvard School of Public Health, a member of the SBoRE group. He says he expects the board to “play primarily an advisory role.” He agreed to join because he “found the foresight behind the establishment of the SBoRE to be novel, unique and likely to have a lasting impact. This impact will not only be through the publications in Science itself, but hopefully through a larger group of publishing places that may want to model their approach after Science.”
　　John Ioannidis, a physician who studies research methodology, says that the policy is “a most welcome step forward” and “long overdue.” “Most journals are weak in statistical review, and this damages the quality of what they publish. I think that, for the majority of scientific papers nowadays, statistical review is more essential than expert review,” he says. But he noted that biomedical journals such as Annals of Internal Medicine, the Journal of the American Medical Association and The Lancet pay strong attention to statistical review.
　　Professional scientists are expected to know how to analyze data, but statistical errors are alarmingly common in published research, according to David Vaux, a cell biologist. Researchers should improve their standards, he wrote in 2012, but journals should also take a tougher line, “engaging reviewers who are statistically literate and editors who can verify the process”. Vaux says that Science’s idea to pass some papers to statisticians “has some merit, but a weakness is that it relies on the board of reviewing editors to identify ‘the papers that need scrutiny’ in the first place”.
　　31. It can be learned from Paragraph 1 that
　　[A] Science intends to simplify their peer-review process.
　　[B] journals are strengthening their statistical checks.
　　[C] few journals are blamed for mistakes in data analysis.
　　[D] lack of data analysis is common in research projects.
　　32. The phrase “flagged up” (Para. 2) is the closest in meaning to
　　[A] found.
　　[B] marked.
　　[C] revised.
　　[D] stored.
　　33. Giovanni Parmigiani believes that the establishment of the SBoRE may
　　[A] pose a threat to all its peers.
　　[B] meet with strong opposition.
　　[C] increase Science’s circulation.
　　[D]set an example for other journals.　
34. David Vaux holds that what Science is doing now
　　[A] adds to researchers’ workload.
　　[B] diminishes the role of reviewers.
　　[C] has room for further improvement.
　　[D]is to fail in the foreseeable future
　　35. Which of the following is the best title of the text?
　　[A] Science Joins Push to Screen Statistics in Papers.
　　[B] Professional Statisticians Deserve More Respect
　　[C] Data Analysis Finds Its Way onto Editors’ Desks
　　[D] Statisticians Are Coming Back with Science

Text 4
　　Two years ago, Rupert Murdoch’s daughter ,Elisabeth ,spoke of the “unsettling dearth of integrity across so many of our institutions” Integrity had collapsed, she argued, because of a collective acceptance that the only  “sorting mechanism ”in society should be profit and the market .But “it’s us ,human beings ,we the people who create the society we want ,not profit ”.
　　Driving her point home, she continued: “It’s increasingly apparent that the absence of purpose, of a moral language within government, media or business could become one of the most dangerous foals for capitalism and freedom.” This same absence of moral purpose was wounding companies such as News International ,shield thought ,making it more likely that it would lose its way as it had with widespread illegal telephone hacking .
　　As the hacking trial concludes C finding guilty ones-editor of the News of the World, Andy Coulson, for conspiring to hack phones ,and finding his predecessor, Rebekah Brooks, innocent of the same charge Cthe winder issue of dearth of integrity still standstill, Journalists are known to have hacked the phones of up to 5,500 people .This is hacking on an industrial scale ,as was acknowledged by Glenn Mulcaire, the man hired by the News of the World in 2001 to be the point person for phone hacking. Others await trial. This long story still unfolds.
　　In many respects, the dearth of moral purpose frames not only the fact of such widespread phone hacking but the terms on which the trial took place .One of the astonishing revelations was how little Rebekah Brooks knew of what went on in her newsroom, wow little she thought to ask and the fact that she never inquired wow the stories arrived. The core of her successful defence was that she knew nothing.
　　In today’s world, title has become normal that well―paid executives should not be accountable for what happens in the organizations that they run perhaps we should not be so surprised. For a generation, the collective doctrine has been that the sorting mechanism of society should be profit. The words that have mattered are efficiency, flexibility, shareholder value, businessCfriendly, wealth generation, sales, impact and, in newspapers, circulation. Words degraded to the margin have been justice fairness, tolerance, proportionality and accountability.
　　The purpose of editing the News of the World was not to promote reader understanding to be fair in what was written or to betray any common humanity. It was to ruin lives in the quest for circulation and impact. Ms Brooks may or may not have had suspicions about how her journalists got their stories, but she asked no questions, gave no instructions―nor received traceable, recorded answers.
　　36. According to the first two paragraphs, Elisabeth was upset by
　　[A] the consequences of the current sorting mechanism
　　[B] companies’ financial loss due to immoral practices.
　　[C] governmental ineffectiveness on moral issues.
　　[D]the wide misuse of integrity among institutions.
　　37. It can be inferred from Paragraph 3 that
　　[A] Glem Mulcaire may deny phone hacking as a crime
　　[B] more journalists may be found guilty of phone hacking.
　　[C] Andy Coulson should be held innocent of the charge.
　　[D] phone hacking will be accepted on certain occasions.
　　38. The author believes the Rebekah Books’s deference
　　[A] revealed a cunning personality
　　[B] centered on trivial issues
　　[C] was hardly convincing
　　[D] was part of a conspiracy
　　39. The author holds that the current collective doctrine shows
　　[A] generally distorted values
　　[B] unfair wealth distribution
　　[C] a marginalized lifestyle
　　[D] a rigid moral cote
　　40. Which of the following is suggested in the last paragraph?
　　[A] The quality of writing is of primary importance.
　　[B] Common humanity is central news reporting.
　　[C] Moral awareness matters in exciting a newspaper.
　　[D] Journalists need stricter industrial regulations.

You infer information you feel the writer has invited you to grasp by presenting you with specific evidence and cues (42) _______
　　Conceived in this way, comprehension will not follow exactly the same track for each reader. What is in question is not the retrieval of an absolute, fixed or “true” meaning that can be read off and clocked for accuracy, or some timeless relation of the text to the world. (43) _______
　　Such background material inevitably reflects who we are, (44) _______This doesn’t, however, make interpretation merely relative or even pointless. Precisely because readers from different historical periods, places and social experiences produce different but overlapping readings of the same words on the page-including for texts that engage with fundamental human concerns-debates about texts can play an important role in social discussion of beliefs and values.
　　How we read a given text also depends to some extent on our particular interest in reading it. (45)_______such dimensions of read suggest-as others introduced later in the book will also do-that we bring an implicit (often unacknowledged) agenda to any act of reading. It doesn’t then necessarily follow that one kind of reading is fuller, more advanced or more worthwhile than another. Ideally, different kinds of reading inform each other, and act as useful reference points for and counterbalances to one another. Together, they make up the reading component of your overall literacy or relationship to your surrounding textual environment.
　　[A] Are we studying that text and trying to respond in a way that fulfils the requirement of a given course? Reading it simply for pleasure? Skimming it for information? Ways of reading on a train or in bed are likely to differ considerably from reading in a seminar room.
　　[B] Factors such as the place and period in which we are reading, our gender ethnicity, age and social class will encourage us towards certain interpretation but at the same time obscure or even close off others.
　　[C] If you are unfamiliar with words or idioms, you guess at their meaning, using clues presented in the contest. On the assumption that they will become relevant later, you make a mental note of discourse entities as well as possible links between them.
　　[D]In effect, you try to reconstruct the likely meanings or effects that any given sentence, image or reference might have had: These might be the ones the author intended.
　　[E]You make further inferences, for instance, about how the test may be significant to you, or about its validity―inferences that form the basis of a personal response for which the author will inevitably be far less responsible.
　　[F]In plays，novels and narrative poems, characters speak as constructs created by the author, not necessarily as mouthpieces for the author’s own thoughts.
　　[G]Rather, we ascribe meanings to test on the basis of interaction between what we might call textual and contextual material: between kinds of organization or patterning we perceive in a text’s formal structures (so especially its language structures) and various kinds of background, social knowledge, belief and attitude that we bring to the text.

Read the following text carefully and then translate the underlined segments into Chinese. Your translation should be written neatly on the ANSWER SHEET. (10 pionts) 
Within the span of a hundred years, in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, a tide if emigration- one of the great folk wanderings of history- swept from Europe to America. (46) This movement, driven by powerful and diverse motivations, built a nation out of a wilderness and, by its nature, shaped the character and destiny of an uncharted continent. 
(47) The United States is the product of two principal forces- the immigration of European people with their varied ideas, customs, and national characteristics and the impact of a new country which modified these traits. Of necessity, colonial America was a projection of Europe. Across the Atlantic came successive groups of Englishmen, Frenchmen, Germans, Scots, Irishmen, Dutchmen, Swedes, and many others who attempt to transplant their habits and traditions to new world. (48) But the force of geographic conditions peculiar to America, the interplay of the varied national groups upon once another, and the sheer difficulty of maintaining old-world ways in a raw, new continent caused significant changes. These changes were gradual and at first scarcely visible. But the result was a new social pattern which, although it resembled European society in many ways, has a character that was distinctly American. 
(49) The first shiploads of immigrants bound for the territory which is now the United States crossed the Atlantic more than a hundred years after the 15th-and- 16th century explorations of North America. In the meantime, thriving Spanish colonies had been established in Mexico, the West Indies, and South America. These travelers to North America came in small, unmercifully overcrowded craft. During their six-to twelve-week voyage, they survived on barely enough food allotted to them. Many of the ships were lost in storms, many passengers died of disease, and infants rarely survived the journey. Sometimes storms blew the vessels far off their course, and often calm brought unbearably long delay. 
To the anxious travelers the sight of the American shore brought almost inexpressible relief. Said one recorder of events, “ The air at twelve leagues? distance smelt as sweet as a new-blown garden.” The colonists? first glimpse of the new land was a sight of dense woods. (50) The virgin forest with its richness and variety of trees was a real treasure-house which extended from Maine all the way down to Georgia. Here was abundant fuel and lumber Here was the raw material of houses and furniture, ships and potash, dyes and naval stores.

2015年考研英语真题答案解析
Section I: Use of English(10 points)
1、【答案】[D] what
　　  【解析】该题考查的是语法知识。根据句子结构和选项的特点，可以判断出空格处应填从属连词引导从句;再根据句子的内容，可以看出该从句是一项研究的相关内容(what)，不是指研究的时间(when)， 原因(why)和方式(how)，因此，该题的答案为what。
　　2、【答案】[B] concluded
　  　【解析】从此题所在的句子的前后内容可以判断出，that is_______ 中的that是指第一句话的内容(朋友与我们基因上的相关性)，很显然是研究得出的结论。因此，答案为concluded。
　　3、【答案】[C] on
　　  【解析】根据空格所在句子的内容(研究对1932分独特的受试者进行分析)判断出进行分析的对象是1932 unique subjects。conduct analysis on…是固定表达。
　　4、【答案】[A] compared
　　  【解析】该空格所在的句子是which 引导的定语从句修饰study,意思是：对几对基因不相关的朋友和陌生人进行_______。因为“研究”的内容是关于朋友间基因上的相关性问题，所以完整的意思应该是：对几对基因不相关的朋友和陌生人进行比较。所以最佳答案为compared。
　　5、【答案】[C] samples
　  　【解析】根据空格的前后内容判断，到第五个空为止，文章都在讲实验过程，和实验对象，第五个空格所在句子的内容是：相同的人们都用于实验中的这两类______。所以根据上下文语境和内容，应该选与实验对象相对应的samples(样例).因此，答案是samples。
　　6、【答案】[A] insignificant
　　  【解析】空的语境为：尽管这1%看起来似乎____，但是遗传学家可不这么认为。空前后形成对比转折的逻辑关系，而从后文列举的例子中可知遗传学家James Fowler对这1%基因的态度是肯定的，故答案为A。
　　7、【答案】[D] know
　  　【解析】空的语境为：大多数人甚至不____他们隔三代的表亲，但却设法选择那些____我们亲戚的人作为朋友。填入的词必须满足前后句之间的转折逻辑关系，四个选项带入，只有D选项符合上下文语义。
　　8、【答案】[A] resemble
　　  【解析】空的语境为：大多数人甚至不认识他们隔三代的表亲，但却设法选择那些____我们亲戚的人作为朋友。根据全文中心：基因上的相似性，可知本题选择A。
　　9、【答案】[B] also
　　  【解析】空所在的句子开头用“The study…”,显然这是对上文话题的继续阐述，前文指出研究发现朋友与我们有1%的基因关系，而空所在句“the genes for smell were something shared in friends”在进一步详细讨论该话题，前后之间是顺接关系，故答案为B。
　　10、【答案】[D] Perhaps
　　   【解析】从选项和文字中句子结构可以判断，空格处要求填入一个能够体现前后两个句子逻辑关系的副词，空前的句子谈到“为什么在嗅觉基因方面存在相似性还很难解释”，空后却紧接着对此得出一个相关结论，很明显是矛盾的，所以此结论只能是一种不确定的推测，故答案为D。
　　11、【答案】[B] to
　　   【解析】该题为介词选择题。后半句出现比较级，可见是和前文形成比较关系，因此和上半句介词保持一致，用介词to。该句翻译：它(这种相似性)吸引我们到相同的环境，并且使我们更为相似。因此答案为to。
　　12、【答案】[A] drive
　   　【解析】该句意思为：很多机制共同作用，从而_____我们选择基因相似的朋友，_____和_____交朋友的“功能关系”。根据上下文可知，此处所填入动词需符合结构_____sb. in doing sth，B选项observe(观察，遵守)和C选项confuse(困惑)均无此用法。符合该结构只有A选项drive(驱使)和D选项limit(限制)。根据上下文可得知：这些机制驱使我们选择基因相似的朋友，符合文章主题。如果选限制则为反向干扰。因此答案为drive。
　　13、【答案】[B] rather than
　　   【解析】所填词为逻辑关系短语，空前说选择基因相似的朋友，空后说具有“实用关系”的朋友，可知前后为对立关系，并且根据文章主题，可知肯定前者而否定后者，可锁定B选项rather than。A选项according to(根据)没有体现出对立及取舍关系，因此排除;C选项regardless of(不管)表让步关系，干扰性较强，但文章更强调取前舍后，因此排除;D选项along with(伴随)表顺接，故排除。故答案为rather than。
　　14、【答案】[D] benefits
　　   【解析】根据前文functional kinship(实用关系)可得出D选项benefits(利益)，前后形成呼应。A选项chances(机会)、B选项responses(反应)、C选项missions(使命)均不符合题意。故答案为benefits。
　　15、【答案】[C] faster
　　   【解析】该句为：evolving ______ than other genes(比其他基因进化得______). 根据同词复现，我们找到该段第二句话中：human evolution picked pace in the last 30,000 years(人类进化在过去30000年间提速)。C 选项faster与下文picked pace(加速)形成呼应，故答案为faster。
　　16、【答案】[C] understand
　　   【解析】此题考查动词。根据语意。空格后面是一个why引导的宾语从句，意为“人类进化在过去三万年间得以加速的原因”，表示这一研究的结果和意义。能与这一宾语从句构成搭配的只有C选项understand。A选项forecast“预测”与“过去三万年”相矛盾，B选项remember“记住”和D选项“express”均不符合文意。
　　17、【答案】[B] contributory
　　   【解析】此空需要填入一个形容词，表达社会环境对人类进步所起到的作用。help，pick pace这两个词表达的都是积极的含义，因此此处需要填入一个带有褒义的感情色彩的词， 因此排除A选项“不可预测的”和D选项“破坏性的”; B 而C选项“可控的”,与语意无关;因此正确答案为B选项contributory“促进的”。
　　18、【答案】[D] tendency
　   　【解析】此处进一步陈述这一研究的结论。A选项endeavor“努力”，B选项“决定”，C选项“安排”，D选项“倾向”。本文的主旨重在解释人们在交朋友的不自觉的一种倾向，而非通过人为的有意识的举动来选择朋友。因此正确答案为D。
　　19、【答案】[C] ethnic
　   　【解析】结合文意，人们普遍希望和有相似基因背景的人。C选项ethnic意为“种族的，民族的”，是对上文中多次重复出现的genes,以及下文的the same population的同义复现。因此正确答案为C。 A选项political“政治的”， B选项“宗教的”，D选项“经济的”均不符合原文文意。
　　20、【答案】[A] see
　　   【解析】此处考察动词，动词势必要看前后搭配。see that 构成固定词组，意为“务必使……”，符合文意，即：即使所有的受访者都拥有欧洲血统，(研究者们)仍然悉心确保所有的受访者、朋友和陌生人都来自于同一群种。选项B“展示”,选项C“证明”，选项D“辨别”均无此含义，且不符合文意。

Section II Reading Comprehension
　　Part A
　　Text 1
　　21、【答案】[D] ended his reign in embarrassment
　　   【解析】事实细节题。根据题干要求，定位到文章前两段。而文章第一段的第二句话提到“But embarrassing scandals and the popularity of the republican left in the recent Euro-elections have forced him to eat his words and stand down.”(在最近的欧洲选举中，令人尴尬的丑闻和受欢迎的共和党，均迫使Carlos收回前言并退位)。D选项中，“stand down”是“end reign”的同义置换，且“embarrassment”与导致Carlos卸任的原因“embarrassing scandals”是相呼应的。故D是正确答案。A、B、C均属于无中生有。
　　22、【答案】[A] owing to their undoubted and respectable status
　　   【解析】事实细节题。根据题干关键词“monarchs”和“heads of state”，定位到第三段的最后一句话“...most royal families have survived because they allow voters to avoid the difficult search for a non-controversial but respected public figure.”(大多数的王室幸存下来是由于他们让选民可以避免去寻找一个不受争议且受尊敬的公众人物的困难)其中“non-controversial but respected public figure”正是A选项中“undoubted and respectable status”的同义置换。故A是正确答案。
　　23、【答案】[B] The role of the nobility in modern democracies
　　   【解析】事实细节题。定位在第四段的最后一句话“...it is bizarre that wealthy aristocratic families should still be the symbolic heart of modern democratic states.”(离奇的是，富有的贵族竟然仍是现代民主国家的象征核心)其中，the symbolic heart of modern democratic states是题干the role of the nobility in modern democracies的同义置换。
　　24、【答案】[D] fails to adapt himself to his future role
　　   【解析】事实细节题。该题考查：英国皇家贵族们非常害怕是因为查尔斯……。根据题干专有名词Charles可定位到文章第七段“the danger will come with Charles...worst enemies”。本段指出“危险源自于查尔斯，他生活奢靡，等级观念显著;并且他没有意识到君王的幸存很大程度上取决于君王提供了公共服务，同时，查尔斯并不知道，国王才是君主制度最大的敌人，而非共和党人。”选项A意为：对待政治问题态度强硬，文章并无提及;选项B意为，对待建议的生活方式改变失败，文章中提到生活方式，但并未提到改变生活方式;选项C意为：视共和党人为潜在盟友，文章中提到，共和党人并非最大的敌人，并未指明把共和党人视为盟友，属于偷换概念，选项D意为：适应未来身份失败，文章指出查尔斯的生活方式，世界观以及他对于君王制度的错误理解均为身份特殊的他的不正确言行，与选项D表述吻合，故为正确答案。
　　25、【答案】[C] Carlos, a Lesson for All European Monarchs
　　    【解析】主旨大意题。该题考察四个选项中哪个可作为文章最佳标题。文章从西班牙国王Carlos退位事件切入，主要讨论当下欧洲君王制度所存在的问题，并非讨论查尔斯的事件，即可排除选项B“查尔斯―继位焦虑”和D“查尔斯―应对威胁缓慢”，而选项A“卡洛斯―荣辱并存” 和C“卡洛斯―欧洲君王们的前车之鉴”中，选项A属于细节信息，不能概括文章大意，选项C可概括，故为正确答案。另外，文章主题词Monarch只有在选项C中出现，也可作为迅速解题的依据。
　　
Text 2
　　26、【答案】[C] check suspects’ phone contents without being authorized
　　   【解析】这是一道事实细节题，根据题干关键词The Supreme Court回文定位到第一段的第二句话，“The Supreme Court will now consider whether police can search for the contents of a mobile phone without a warrant if the phone is on or around a person during an arrest”,一一比对选项，原文中的“police can search for the contents of a mobile phone without a warrant”与选项C “check suspects’ phone contents without being authorized”是同义替换，其他选项均是无关选项。
　　27、【答案】[A] disapproval
　　   【解析】本题是观点态度题，考察作者的态度。根据题干关键词“California’s argument”，可以定位到文章第四段第一句“They should start by discarding California’s lame argument…”。由第四段第一句话中的“discard(抛弃)”和“lame(没有说服力的)”可以看出作者对于California’s argument 是不支持的态度，因此选A。
　　28、【答案】[A] getting into one’s residence
　   　【解析】根据题干关键词the author believes和“exploring one’s phone contents is comparable to”可回文定位到文章第四段第三句“But exploring one’s smartphone is more like entering his or her home”，选项A语义与之一致，其中，getting into与entering对应，one’s residence与his or her home对应，故A选项为正确答案。
　　29、【答案】[C] citizens’ privacy is not effectively protected
　　   【解析】根据题干信息In paragraphs 5and 6定位第5段第一句话“Americans should take steps to protect their digital privacy.及第6段最后一句话，...and they could take reasonable measures to.....，可推知作者的顾虑，因此答案为C.
　　30、【答案】[A] the Constitution should be implemented flexibly
　   　【解析】这是一道例证题，根据题干关键词Orin Kerr可以回文定位到文章最后一段。作者引用Orin Kerr这个人的比较是为了说明相关的论点。分析最后一段结构可知，最后一段的第三句和第四句都是在阐述该例子本身，所以相关论点应该往前面找，即是第二句话，“New，disruptive technology sometimes demands novel applications of the Constitution’s protection”,选项A与之同义替换，其中，be implemented和applications对应，novel和flexibly对应。
　　
Text 3
　　31、【答案】[B] journals are strengthening their statistical checks
　    　【解析】推理题。根据题干直接定位到第一段。解题关键在于第二句The policy follows similar efforts from other journals(该政策得到其他期刊类似的努力)the policy指第一句The journal Science is adding an extra round of statistical checks to its peer-review process, (《科学》杂志把统计检查额外添加到它的同行评审过程中)，由此可直接推断出正确答案为[B] journals are strengthening their statistical checks (各大期刊正在加强统计数字检查)。选项[A]中simplify与原文语意不符，所以选项C、D属于无中生有。
　　32、【答案】[C] marked
　    　【解析】词义题。根据题干定位回第二段第三句Manuscript will be flagged up for additional scrutiny by the journal’s internal editors, (杂志内部编辑将通过更多的审查来标记手稿)。文中运用代入法，把各选项代入句中替换，可知选项C marked(标记)为正确答案。选项A found(发现，找到)，选项B revised(修改)，选项 D stored(存储)。
　　33、【答案】[D] set an example for other journals
　　   【解析】细节题。根据题干关键词Giovanni Parmigiani，the establishment of the SBoRE和may定位到第四段的最后一句“… but hopefully through a larger group of publishing places that may want to model their approach after Science。选项中的example是model的同义替换，others journals是原文中a larger group of publishing places的同义替换。
　　文章中出现了hopefully，表示作者积极的态度。选项A中的threat，选项B中的opposition分别表达负向消极的态度，所以错误。选项C increase Science’s circulation(增加《科学》杂志的发行量)，文章并未提到，属于无中生有。
　　34、【答案】[C] has room for further improvement
　   　【解析】细节题。由题干关键词David Vaux和Science，可定位到第六段最后一句。Vaux says that Science’s idea to pass some papers to statisticians “has some merit, but a weakness is that it relies on the board of reviewing editors to identify ‘the papers that need scrutiny’ in the first place”. (《科学》杂志把论文推给统计员审核有一些优点，但缺点是它依赖于审稿编委会首先需要确定审查的文件。)
　　选项A中workload，选项B. diminish the role of reviewers和选项D中的foreseeable future没有提到，属于无中生有。
　　35、【答案】A science joins push to screen statistics in papers
　   　【解析】文章第一段由Science将增加statistical checks引出话题，接下来各段就此问题McNutt, Giovanni Parmigianni, John Ioannidis, David Vaux提出各自的看法。文中statistical，papers反复提及，可知该词是文中核心词。选项B和选项D首先排除，偏离主题，statisticians仅在文中提及，非重点讨论内容;选项C与文中主题相差较大，因此排除。
　　
Text 4
　　36、【答案】[A] the consequences of the current sorting mechanism
　　   【解析】通过题干可以将此题锁定在前两段。第一段指出Elisabeth谈到了“我们很多机构都面临着令人沮丧的正直感的丧失”。接下来第二句指出这种正直感的丧失是因为大家普遍认为社会中唯一的分类机制(sorting mechanism)应该是利益和市场。而从第一段最后一句我们看出，她认为“应该是我们人类自己创造我们想要的社会，而不应该是利益”。可见，Elisabeth很不认可目前的这种分类机制(sorting mechanism)以及所造成的不良后果，这也正是她感到沮丧的原因。故A选项consequence of the current sorting mechanism(目前这种分类机制的后果)是真正让她沮丧的原因。
　　37、【答案】[B] more journalists may be found guilty of phone hacking
　　   【解析】第三段第一句指出，Andy Coulson因为参与手机黑客案件被裁定有罪，然而他的前任却被认定是无罪的。通过这一事件，作者得出由此造成的道德沦丧广泛问题依然存在(the wider issue of dearth of integrity still stands)。即仍然存在一些人没有被裁定有罪。接着文章指出了在新闻业中，已经有记者被认定非法侵入用户手机。而还有一些在等待审判(others await trial)，由此可以推出，将会有更多的记者因为涉及手机黑客案件而被裁定有罪。故正确答案为选项B。
　　38、【答案】[C] was hardly convincing
　   　【解析】根据题干中的“defence”可以回文定位到文章第四段最后一句话。该句指出Ms. Brooks辩护成功的关键在于她对这个事件一无所知(she knew nothing)。而作者在该段第一句话中指出，道德丧失不仅体现在普遍存在的手机黑客这一事实上，更体现在一些审判案件所使用的条款上，其中最震惊的就是对Ms. Brooks的审判。可见，作者对该案的审判持否定态度。因此，认为她的辩护是不可信的。故正确答案为C。
　　39、【答案】[A] (generally distorted values)
　　   【解析】通过题干中的“collective doctrine”可以直接定位到文中第五段第三行。该句指出“collective doctrine”是社会的分类机制应该是利益。接下来可以看出，那些真正起作用的是那些表示利益的词“efficiency，flexibility，shareholder value，business-friendly，wealth generation…”，而表示公平、正义的词(Justice，fairness，tolerance…)则被置于边缘。可见，这种教义(collective doctrine)只关注利益，而忽略了公平与正义，这显然是一种扭曲的价值观。故A选项正确。
　　40、【答案】[C] moral awareness matters in editing a newspaper
　　   【解析】这是一道开放式推理题。作者在最后一段前两句话指出，新闻报道的目的不是为了促进读者的理解，也不是为了追求公平或者违背人类共有的人性，而是通过追求发行量的影响率来破坏人们的生活。即文章从一开始指出的一个问题，为了追求利益而造成了正值感的丧失。从“ruin”一词可以看出，作者对新闻记者的这一行为持否定的态度。并且通过Ms. Brooks女士的行为加以佐证。作者通过正话反说的方式，突出新闻报道过程中正值感的重要性。故正确答案为C，moral awareness matters in editing a newspaper(在新闻报道中，道德意识很重要)，其中moral awareness和integrity是同义互换。
　　
Part B
　　41、【答案】[C] If you are unfamiliar with words or idioms...
　　   【解析】从首段疑问句可以看出文章主题围绕如何阅读来进行展开。41题空在段中间，需要看空处的前一句和后一句，前一句说的是要去理解单词的含义，并关注句法，而后一句说开始推测文章语境。所以可以推测出41题空处应该说的是单词语义和语境之间的联系，关键词就是words和context。纵览选项，只有C项符合语境和关键词要求，属同词复现，上下文语义逻辑关联。故正确答案选C。
　　42、【答案】[E] You make further inferences, for instance...
　   　【解析】该题空在段末，需要看空处的前一句和下一段首句，前一句说的是我们通过作者给出的一些具体线索来理解含义，而下一段首句说通过这种方式表达，每个人的理解都会有所不同。所以可以推测出42空处内容要有关根据作者给的线索推测信息，而且可能会涉及不同的人有不同的理解，关键词是infer, the writer和each reader。纵览选项，只有E项符合语境且出现inferences, the author, personal，属同义词复现。故正确答案选E。
　　43、【答案】[G] Rather, we ascribe meanings to texts on the basis...
　　   【解析】空格后出现明显的指代线索词such background material，所以空格内必定要出现相关的信息，浏览选项，G选项中textual and contextual material，background与空后线索实现代词指代复现。而且G选项中的rather,与空前what is in question is not...实现语义逻辑关联。确定此选项为正确答案。
　　44、【答案】[B] Factors such as the place and period in which...
　　   【解析】空前的线索词为who we are，空后的线索为转折逻辑关系，意思是“但这并不会使得理解仅仅有关联或者毫无意义”，关键词为interpretation，relative，pointless，空格中需要出现与此相关联的词汇，浏览后面选项，B选项中出现原词interpretations，而且此选项中的gender, ethnicity, age, social class与空前线索词who we are 相对应。确定正确答案为此选项。
　　45、【答案】[A] Are we studying that text and trying to respond...
　　   【解析】空格在最后一段的中间，线索需要从空格前后寻找，空前为概括的句子，关键词为particular interest,空后出现代词指代的线索，such dimensions of reading suggest,结合关键词可以得知空格所填的部分内容需要涉及到“阅读的兴趣以及阅读维度”，浏览选项，A选项提到的诸多问题正是有关读书的兴趣以及阅读的维度。因此确定A为正确选项。

　　Unfolded in the elaborately painted cartoon is a thought-provoking scene: four youngsters are sitting together to have their gathering feast. However, much of their attention has been attached to their mobile cell phones, totally forgetting what they are gathering for. Just as is put in the caption of this cartoon, it is typically a“Dinner party in mobile era.”
　　This picture is naturally associated with a wide-spreading phenomenon in contemporary society―too much addiction to the mobile phones. Indeed, we have all stepped into an era of getting and staying in touch with others through telecommunication. Each of us seems close to another under this circumstance, but we have to look at the side-effect of the technology: the high-tech electronic products also cut off the face-to-face communication. To be specific, in our daily life, it’s not uncommon that on buses or subways, or walking on the road, we are all playing with phones or pads for recreation, such as reading novels, watching videos or movies, surfing the Internet, and so on, even though we travel with our friends, parents or loved one.
　　Evidently, we should take a rational attitude towards this issue, but how? The media should promote the awareness of healthy lifestyle among the public, especially the young. Meanwhile, social activities, either in communities or on campuses, should be launched so that people can get back to the real world.

 Part A

 Read the following four texts. Answer the questions below each text by choosing A, B, C or D. Mark your answers on the ANSWER SHEET. (40 points)
Text 1
 In order to “change lives for the better” and reduce “dependency” George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer, introduced the “upfront work search” scheme. Only if the jobless arrive at the jobcentre with a CV, register for online job search, and start looking for work will they be eligible for benefit and then they should report weekly rather than fortnightly. What could be more reasonable?
  More apparent reasonableness followed. There will now be a seven-day wait for the jobseeker’s allowance. “Those first few days should be spent looking for work, not looking to sign on.” he claimed. “We’re doing these things because we know they help people stay off benefits and help those on benefits get into work faster.” Help? Really? On first hearing, this was the socially concerned chancellor, trying to change lives for the better, complete with “reforms” to an obviously indulgent system that demands too little effort from the newly unemployed to find work, and subsidises laziness. What motivated him, we were to understand, was his zeal for “fundamental fairness”― protecting the taxpayer, controlling spending and ensuring that only the most deserving claimants received their benefits.
  Losing a job is hurting: you don’t skip down to the jobcentre with a song in your heart, delighted at the prospect of doubling your income from the generous state. It is financially terrifying, psychologically embarrassing and you know that support is minimal and extraordinarily hard to get. You are now not wanted; you support is minimal and extraordinarily hard to get. You are now not wanted; you are now excluded from the work environment that offers purpose and structure in your life. Worse, the crucial income to feed yourself and your family and pay the bills has disappeared. Ask anyone newly unemployed what they want and the answer is always: a job.
 But in Osborneland, your first instinct is to fall into dependency ― permanent dependency if you can get it ― supported by a state only too ready to indulge your falsehood. It is as though 20 years of ever-tougher reforms of the job search and benefit administration system never happened. The principle of British welfare is no longer that you can insure yourself against the risk of unemployment and receive unconditional payments if the disaster happens. Even the very phrase “jobseeker’s allowance” ― invented in 1996 ― is about redefining the unemployed as a “jobseeker” who had no mandatory right to a benefit he or she has earned through making national insurance contributions. Instead, the claimant receives a time-limited “allowance,” conditional on actively seeking a job; no entitlement and no insurance, at ￡71.70 a week, one of the least generous in the EU.

 21. George Osborne’s scheme was intended to
 [A]provide the unemployed with easier access to benefits.
 [B]encourage jobseekers’ active engagement in job seeking.
 [C]motivate the unemployed to report voluntarily.
 [D]guarantee jobseekers’ legitimate right to benefits.
 22. The phrase, “to sign on” (Line 3, Para. 2) most probably means
 [A]to check on the availability of jobs at the jobcentre.
 [B]to accept the government’s restrictions on the allowance.
 [C]to register for an allowance from the government.
 [D]to attend a governmental job-training program.
 23. What prompted the chancellor to develop his scheme?
 [A]A desire to secure a better life for all.
 [B]An eagerness to protect the unemployed.
 [C]An urge to be generous to the claimants.
 [D]A passion to ensure fairness for taxpayers.
 24. According to Paragraph 3, being unemployed makes one feel
 [A]uneasy
 [B]enraged.
 [C]insulted.
 [D]guilty.
 25. To which of the following would the author most probably agree?
 [A]The British welfare system indulges jobseekers’ laziness.
 [B]Osborne’s reforms will reduce the risk of unemployment.
 [C]The jobseekers’ allowance has met their actual needs.
 [D]Unemployment benefits should not be made conditional.

Text 2
 All around the world, lawyers generate more hostility than the members of any other profession―with the possible exception of journalism. But there are few places where clients have more grounds for complaint than America.
 During the decade before the economic crisis, spending on legal services in America grew twice as fast as inflation. The best lawyers made skyscrapers-full of money, tempting ever more students to pile into law schools. But most law graduates never get a big-firm job. Many of them instead become the kind of nuisance-lawsuit filer that makes the tort system a costly nightmare.
 There are many reasons for this. One is the excessive costs of a legal education. There is just one path for a lawyer in most American states: a four-year undergraduate degree in some unrelated subject, then a three-year law degree at one of 200 law schools authorized by the American Bar Association and an expensive preparation for the bar exam. This leaves today’s average law-school graduate with $100,000 of debt on top of undergraduate debts. Law-school debt means that many cannot afford to go into government or non-profit work, and that they have to work fearsomely hard.
 Reforming the system would help both lawyers and their customers. Sensible ideas have been around for a long time, but the state-level bodies that govern the profession have been too conservative to implement them. One idea is to allow people to study law as an undergraduate degree. Another is to let students sit for the bar after only two years of law school. If the bar exam is truly a stern enough test for a would-be lawyer, those who can sit it earlier should be allowed to
 do so. Students who do not need the extra training could cut their debt mountain by a third.
 The other reason why costs are so high is the restrictive guild-like ownership structure of the business. Except in the District of Columbia, non-lawyers may not own any share of a law firm. This keeps fees high and innovation slow. There is pressure for change from within the profession, but opponents of change among the regulators insist that keeping outsiders out of a law firm isolates lawyers from the pressure to make money rather than serve clients ethically.
 In fact, allowing non-lawyers to own shares in law firms would reduce costs and improve services to customers, by encouraging law firms to use technology and to employ professional managers to focus on improving firms’ efficiency. After all, other countries, such as Australia and Britain, have started liberalizing their legal professions. America should follow.
 26.a lot of students take up law as their profession due to
 [A]the growing demand from clients.
 [B]the increasing pressure of inflation.
 [C]the prospect of working in big firms.
 [D]the attraction of financial rewards.
 27.Which of the following adds to the costs of legal education in most American states?
 [A]Higher tuition fees for undergraduate studies.
 [B]Admissions approval from the bar association.
 [C]Pursuing a bachelor’s degree in another major.
 [D]Receiving training by professional associations.
 28.Hindrance to the reform of the legal system originates from
 [A]lawyers’ and clients’ strong resistance.
 [B]the rigid bodies governing the profession.
 [C]the stem exam for would-be lawyers.
 [D]non-professionals’ sharp criticism.
 29.The guild-like ownership structure is considered “restrictive”partly because it
 [A]bans outsiders’ involvement in the profession.
 [B]keeps lawyers from holding law-firm shares.
 [C]aggravates the ethical situation in the trade.
 [D]prevents lawyers from gaining due profits.
 30.In this text, the author mainly discusses
 [A]flawed ownership of America’s law firms and its causes.
 [B]the factors that help make a successful lawyer in America.
 [C]a problem in America’s legal profession and solutions to it.
 [D]the role of undergraduate studies in America’s legal education.

 The US$3-million Fundamental physics prize is indeed an interesting experiment, as Alexander Polyakov said when he accepted this year’s award in March. And it is far from the only one of its type. As a News Feature article in Nature discusses, a string of lucrative awards for researchers have joined the Nobel Prizes in recent years. Many, like the Fundamental Physics Prize, are funded from the telephone-number-sized bank accounts of Internet entrepreneurs. These benefactors have succeeded in their chosen fields, they say, and they want to use their wealth to draw attention to those who have succeeded in science.
 What’s not to like? Quite a lot, according to a handful of scientists quoted in the News Feature. You cannot buy class, as the old saying goes, and these upstart entrepreneurs cannot buy their prizes the prestige of the Nobels, The new awards are an exercise in self-promotion for those behind them, say scientists. They could distort the achievement-based system of peer-review-led  research. They could cement the status quo of peer-reviewed research. They do not fund peer-reviewed research. They perpetuate the myth of the lone genius.
 The goals of the prize-givers seem as scattered as the criticism. Some want to shock, others to draw people into science, or to better reward those who have made their careers in research.
 As Nature has pointed out before, there are some legitimate concerns about how science prizes―both new and old―are distributed. The Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, launched this year, takes an unrepresentative view of what the life sciences include. But the Nobel Foundation’s limit of three recipients per prize, each of whom must still be living, has long been outgrown by the collaborative nature of modern research―as will be demonstrated by the inevitable row over who is ignored when it comes to acknowledging the discovery of the Higgs boson. The Nobels were, of course, themselves set up by a very rich individual who had decided what he wanted to do with his own money. Time, rather than intention, has given them legitimacy.
 As much as some scientists may complain about the new awards, two things seem clear. First, most researchers would accept such a prize if they were offered one. Second, it is surely a good thing that the money and attention come to science rather than go elsewhere, It is fair to criticize and question the mechanism―that is the culture of research, after all―but it is the prize-givers’ money to do with as they please. It is wise to take such gifts with gratitude and grace.
 31. The Fundamental Physics Prize is seen as
 [A]a symbol of the entrepreneurs’ wealth.
 [B]a possible replacement of the Nobel Prizes.
 [C]an example of bankers’ investments.
 [D]a handsome reward for researchers.
 32. The critics think that the new awards will most benefit
 [A]the profit-oriented scientists.
 [B]the founders of the new awards.
 [C]the achievement-based system.
 [D]peer-review-led research.
 33. The discovery of the Higgs boson is a typical case which involves
 [A]controversies over the recipients’ status.
 [B]the joint effort of modern researchers.
 [C]legitimate concerns over the new prizes.
 [D]the demonstration of research findings.
 34. According to Paragraph 4,which of the following is true of the Nobels?
 [A]Their endurance has done justice to them.
 [B]Their legitimacy has long been in dispute.
 [C]They are the most representative honor.
 [D]History has never cast doubt on them.
 35.The author believes that the now awards are
 [A]acceptable despite the criticism.
 [B]harmful to the culture of research.
 [C]subject to undesirable changes.
 [D]unworthy of public attention.

Text 4
“The Heart of the Matter,” the just-released report by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS), deserves praise for affirming the importance of the humanities and social sciences to the prosperity and security of liberal democracy in America. Regrettably, however, the report’s failure to address the true nature of the crisis facing liberal education may cause more harm than good.
 In 2010, leading congressional Democrats and Republicans sent letters to the AAAS asking that it identify actions that could be taken by “federal, state and local governments, universities, foundations, educators, individual benefactors and others” to “maintain national excellence in humanities and social scientific scholarship and education.” In response, the American Academy formed the Commission on the Humanities and Social Sciences. Among the commission’s 51 members are top-tier-university presidents, scholars, lawyers, judges, and business executives, as well as prominent figures from diplomacy, filmmaking, music and journalism.
 The goals identified in the report are generally admirable. Because representative government presupposes an informed citizenry, the report supports full literacy; stresses the study of history and government, particularly American history and American government; and encourages the use of new digital technologies. To encourage innovation and competition, the report calls for increased investment in research, the crafting of coherent curricula that improve students’ ability to solve problems and communicate effectively in the 21st century, increased funding for teachers and the encouragement of scholars to bring their learning to bear on the great challenges of the day. The report also advocates greater study of foreign languages, international affairs and the expansion of study abroad programs.
 Unfortunately, despite 2? years in the making, "The Heart of the Matter" never gets to the heart of the matter: the illiberal nature of liberal education at our leading colleges and universities. The commission ignores that for several decades America's colleges and universities have produced graduates who don’t know the content and character of liberal education and are thus deprived of its benefits. Sadly, the spirit of inquiry once at home on campus has been replaced by the use of the humanities and social sciences as vehicles for publicizing “progressive,” or left-liberal propaganda.
 Today, professors routinely treat the progressive interpretation of history and progressive public policy as the proper subject of study while portraying conservative or classical liberal ideas―such as free markets and self-reliance―as falling outside the boundaries of routine, and sometimes legitimate, intellectual investigation.
 The AAAS displays great enthusiasm for liberal education. Yet its report may well set back reform by obscuring the depth and breadth of the challenge that Congress asked it to illuminate.
 36. According to Paragraph 1, what is the author’s attitude toward the AAAS’s report?
 [A] Critical
 [B] Appreciative
 [C] Contemptuous
 [D] Tolerant
 37. Influential figures in the Congress required that the AAAS report on how to
 [A] retain people’s interest in liberal education
 [B] define the government’s role in education
 [C] keep a leading position in liberal education
 [D] safeguard individuals’ rights to education
 38. According to Paragraph 3, the report suggests
 [A] an exclusive study of American history
 [B] a greater emphasis on theoretical subjects
 [C] the application of emerging technologies
 [D] funding for the study of foreign languages
 39. The author implies in Paragraph 5 that professors are
 [A] supportive of free markets
 [B] cautious about intellectual investigation
 [C] conservative about public policy
 [D] biased against classical liberal ideas
 40. Which of the following would be the best title for the text?
 [A] Ways to Grasp “The Heart of the Matter”
[B] Illiberal Education and “The Heart of the Matter”
[C] The AAAS’s Contribution to Liberal Education
 [D] Progressive Policy vs. Liberal Education

[A] Some archaeological sites have always been easily observable―for example, the Parthenon in Athens, Greece, the pyramids of Giza in Egypt; and the megaliths of Stonehenge in southern England. But these sites are exceptions to the norm. Most archaeological sites have been located by means of careful searching, while many others have been discovered by accident. Olduvai Gorge, an early hominid site in Tanzania, was found by a butterfly hunter who literally fell into its deep valley in 1911. Thousands of Aztec artifacts came to light during the digging of the Mexico City subway in the 1970s.
 [B]In another case, American archaeologists Rene Million and George Cowgill spent years systematically mapping the entire city of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico near what is now Mexico City. At its peak around AD 600, this city was one of the largest human settlements in the world. The researchers mapped not only the city’s vast and ornate ceremonial areas, but also hundreds of simpler apartment complexes where common people lived.
 [C] How do archaeologists know where to find what they are looking for when there is nothing visible on the surface of the ground? Typically, they survey and sample (make test excavations on) large areas of terrain to determine where excavation will yield useful information. Surveys and test samples have also become important for understanding the larger landscapes that contain archaeological sites.
 [D] Surveys can cover a single large settlement or entire landscapes. In one case, many researchers working around the ancient Maya city of Copan, Honduras, have located hundreds of small rural villages and individual dwellings by using aerial photographs and by making surveys on foot. The resulting settlement maps show how the distribution and density of the rural population around the city changed dramatically between AD 500 and 850, when Copan collapsed.
 [E] To find their sites, archaeologists today rely heavily on systematic survey methods and a variety of high-technology tools and techniques. Airborne technologies, such as different types of radar and photographic equipment carried by airplanes or spacecraft, allow archaeologists to learn about what lies beneath the ground without digging. Aerial surveys locate general areas of interest or larger buried features, such as ancient buildings or fields.
 [F] Most archaeological sites, however, are discovered by archaeologists who have set out to look for them. Such searches can take years. British archaeologist Howard Carter knew that the tomb of the Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun existed from information found in other sites. Carter sifted through rubble in the Valley of the Kings for seven years before he located the tomb in 1922. In the late 1800s British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evan combed antique dealers’ stores in Athens, Greece. He was searching for tiny engraved seals attributed to the ancient Mycenaean culture that dominated Greece from the 1400s to 1200s BC. Evans’s interpretations of these engravings eventually led him to find the Minoan palace at Knossos (Knossós) on the island of Crete, in 1900.
 [G] Ground surveys allow archaeologists to pinpoint the places where digs will be successful. Most ground surveys involve a lot of walking, looking for surface clues such as small fragments of pottery. They often include a certain amount of digging to test for buried materials at selected points across a landscape. 
Archaeologists also may locate buried remains by using such technologies as ground radar, magnetic-field recording, and metal detectors. Archaeologists commonly use computers to map sites and the landscapes around sites. Two and three-dimensional maps are helpful tools in planning excavations, illustrating how sites look, and presenting the results of archaeological research.

     Music means different things to different people and sometimes even different things to the same person at different moments of his life. It might be poetic, philosophical, sensual, or mathematical, but in any case it must, in my view, have something to do with the soul of the human being. Hence it is metaphysical; but the means of expression is purely and exclusively physical: sound. I believe it is precisely this permanent coexistence of metaphysical message through physical means that is the strength of music. (46)It is also the reason why when we try to describe music with words, all we can do is articulate our reactions to it, and not grasp music itself.
     Beethoven’s importance in music has been principally defined by the revolutionary nature of his compositions. He freed music from hitherto prevailing conventions of harmony and structure. Sometimes I feel in his late works a will to break all signs of continuity. The music is abrupt and seemingly disconnected, as in the last piano sonata. In musical expression, he did not feel restrained by the weight of convention. (47)By all accounts he was a freethinking person, and a courageous one, and I find courage an essential quality for the understanding, let alone the performance, of his works.
     This courageous attitude in fact becomes a requirement for the performers of Beethoven’s music. His compositions demand the performer to show courage, for example in the use of dynamics. (48)Beethoven’s habit of increasing the volume with an intense crescendo and then abruptly following it with a sudden soft passage was only rarely used by composers before him.
     Beethoven was a deeply political man in the broadest sense of the word. He was not interested in daily politics, but concerned with questions of moral behavior and the larger questions of right and wrong affecting the entire society. (49)Especially significant was his view of freedom, which, for him, was associated with the rights and responsibilities of the individual: he advocated freedom of thought and of personal expression.
     Beethoven’s music tends to move from chaos to order as if order were an imperative of human existence. For him, order does not result from forgetting or ignoring the disorders that plague our existence; order is a necessary development, an improvement that may lead to the Greek ideal of spiritual elevation. It is not by chance that the Funeral March is not the last movement of the Eroica Symphony, but the second, so that suffering does not have the last word. (50)One could interpret much of the work of Beethoven by saying that suffering is inevitable, but the courage to fight it renders life worth living.

Section II Reading Comprehension
Part A
真题解析：文章概括：政府大臣Grorge Osbome提出了一个项目帮助失业的人找工作。
Text 1
21、【答案】[B]encourage jobseekers’ active engagement in job seeking.　 
【解析】细节题。本道题的关键是intended to问的是目的，所以我们也应该去寻找体现目的性的词汇，所以在首段首句看到了in order to ,则后面的内容即为本题答案，结合后面找工作的内容则选择B选项。
22．【答案】[C]to register for an allowance from the government.
　 【解析】词义句意题。先根据题干定位到第二段第三行，to sign on前面有一个很明显的not，则我们可以推知，这一定是前面的反义，我们只要读懂前面半部分就可以了，前面说应该spend looking for work，正好和A选项相符，所以我们只要选择一个相反的选项即可，则选择C选项。
23. 【答案】[A]A desire to secure a better life for all.
【解析】细节题。本道题的关键是题目中的prompted和chancellor，根据chancellor能定位到二段第五行，再向下寻找则可发现motivate和prompt是对应的，所以看本句即可发现和A选项是对应的。
24.【答案】[A]uneasy.
　 【解析】细节题。本道题根据unemployed回到文中定位在第三段的最后一句，没有感觉相关内容，所以需要向前找答案，再根据本段第一句话中的losing a job即可判定答案在第二句，因此选择A选项。另我们会发现BCD三个选项趋于强烈和负面，所以，我们选择A选项。
25.【答案】[B]Osborne’s reforms will reduce the risk of unemployment.
【解析】本题题根据选项定位。A选项根据大写字母The British welfare system定位到最后一段的第三句，原文是“no longer”，选项与原文反向干扰。B选项根据Osborne’s reforms
定位到第一段第二句，可以得出该项目可减少失业危险，所以B为正确答案。C选项根据题干“the jobseekers’ allowance”定位到最后一段倒数第二句，该句提到“no fundamental right”，恰与C选项表意相反，所以C是反向干扰。D选项根据题干“conditional”定位到最后一段最后一句，其中只提到“conditional on actively seeking a job…”，并没有要说以后应该怎样，所以属于无中生有。

Text 2
26.【答案】[D]the attraction of financial rewards.
【解析】该题是因果细节题，考察细节。首先，根据段落定位原则模糊定位，定位到前几段。其次，再精确定位，题干中有关键词“students”“law”“profession”，回到原文寻找相关信息。第一段未发现相关信息，然后到第二段看到“The best lawyers made skyscrapers-full of money, tempting ever more students to pile into law schools.”与题干有重合之处，选项D是该句的同义替换。A、B、C三个选项根据原文个别词汇“clients”“inflation”“big-firm”等进行干扰。注意，第一段的But是个假转折词，并非答案处。
27.【答案】[C]Pursuing a bachelor’s degree in another major.
【解析】该题是细节题，考察细节。首先根据段落定位原则定位到第三段。其次，根据题干关键词“the costs of legal education”精确定位到第三段第二句话“One is the excessive costs of a legal education.”问题是“which of the following adds to the costs of legal education”，因此定位句的下一句就是答案，即“There is just one path for a lawyer in most American states: a four-year undergraduate degree in some unrelated subject, then a three-year law degree at one of 200 law schools accredited by the American Bar Association and an expensive preparation for the bar exam.”分析选项可知，选项C恰当概况了该句子的涵义。A选项利用三段末尾的“This leaves today’s average law-school graduate with $100,000 of debt on top of undergraduate debts.”进行干扰。B选项无中生有。D选项根据四段最后一句出现的“training”个别词汇进行干扰。
28.【答案】[B]the rigid bodies governing the profession.
　  【解析】该题是原因细节题，问来源。首先段落定位原则定位到第四段。其次，根据题干关键词“the reform of the legal system”定位到第二句“Sensible ideas have been around for a long time, but the state-level bodies that govern the profession have been too conservative to implement them.”选项B即为该句的同义替换。
29. 【答案】[A]bans outsiders’ involvement in the profession.
【解析】该题为因果细节题，问原因。根据段落定位原则定位至倒数第二段。其次，题干中出现“the guild-like ownership structure”，精确定位到第二句“Except in the District of Columbia, non-lawyers may not own any share of a law firm. This keeps fees high and innovation slow.”此外，在该段最后一句提到“…keeping outsiders out of a law firm isolates lawyers from the pressure to make money rather than serve clients ethically.”从而可以得出答案选A。
30.【答案】[C]a problem in America’s legal profession and solutions to it.
【解析】该题为文章主旨题，考察文章中心。该篇文章属于问题解决型文章，前5段均在说美国法律职业存在的问题，最后一段提出了解决措施“allowing non-lawyers to own shares in law firms would reduce costs and improve services to customers, by encouraging law firms to use technology and to employ professional managers to focus on improving firms’ efficiency.”。因此，该篇属于问题解决型文章，选C。其他几个选项均为文中的个别细节，以偏概全。

真题解析：
文章主题及背景知识：此篇阅读的主题内容为“基础物理学奖”，如果对于这一背景信息有所了解，这篇文章便可轻松看懂，做题更是十拿九稳!与2013年相比，2014考研阅读文章同样注重时效性，Text3便是反应了2013年3月份的一次实时事件：基础物理学基金会于3月20日晚在瑞士日内瓦揭晓了2013年基础物理学奖!所以2015考研的同学们一定要多多关注社会热点话题，拓展视野，丰富自己的文化背景知识，这样才能取得事半功倍的效果!
文章讲到的是关于和诺贝尔奖一样的奖金丰厚的奖项出现，这些奖项就是由一些网络的公司或者是一些新贵们他们得出这样大量的钱，当然会遭出一些批评，这些奖项还是没法和诺贝尔奖相比的，阶级是没法改变的，名望是没法购买的。当然这一系列的东西，在前三段当中谈到之后，到了最后一段，作者表明他的观点，纵然这些对科学家的奖励在奖项上存在着一些瑕疵，存在着一些不合理的地方。但是对于科学家来说，有人给你钱支持你的研究，终归是好的。也就是说从31到35题基本上没有难题，也没有可以去争议的，也是既所得的文章。
31.【答案】[A]a symbol of the entrepreneurs’s wealth.
　　【解析】细节题。根据题干中的Fundamental Physics Prize可以定位到第一段，但除此之外就没有其他细节提示信息了，所以我们只能根据几个选项去定位，分别根据选项中的entrepreneurs、Nobel Prize、investment、reward去定位，在第一段末句找到了与A选项相一致的句子，则判定A选项正确。
32.【答案】[B]the founders of the new award.
【解析】 细节题。根据题干中的critics定位到第三段，可知第二段没有出题，从第三段第二句可以得出本道题的正确选项，who have made their careers in research即为B选项中的The founders。
33.【答案】[D]the demonstration of research findings.　
【解析】 细节题。本道题如果从题干中看更像是例证题，但题目中说道the case involves即问例子本身，所以为一道细节题。我们在第四段倒数第三句中找到了Higgs boson，定位到本句可以得知nature of modern research---as well as demonstrated by……即为本道题正确答案。
34.【答案】[A]Their endurance has done justice to them.
【解析】判断题。此类题型是考试中的一个难点，在题干中提示信息非常少，所以我们需要根据每个选项分别定位。A选项的durance定位到本段最后一句time。B选项根据legitimacy定位到第一句。C选项没有提到。D选项从最后一段可以验证确实是收到了质疑，B选项和原文不符，可以得知答案为A。
35.【答案】[A]acceptable despite the criticism.
【解析】主旨题。本题属于作者观点，出在最后一段则说明更多体现了文章的主旨，因为还有一个段落对应，则我们可以在最后一段找答案，根据题干中的award我们可以得知全文的最后一句明确体现了作者的观点，故选A。

Text 4
本篇文章选自华尔街日报。主要讲的是非自由教育以及”问题核心”这个报告。
36.【答案】[A] Critical
【解析】细节态度题。并非考察全文的态度，也就是说要细节定位。根据题干定位原则，定位第一段AAAS出现之处，并且一定要找到表示评价的部分。该题迷惑性很强，因为文章在AAAS后面就又”praise”所以容易误导大家选择答案B “appreciative(欣赏的)”，但是我们应该看到有however，我们知道如果第一段出现转折，那此转折一定跟主旨有关。同时各个题都与主旨相关，所以这道题应该于主旨相关，后文中的“may cause more harm than good.”让我们知道它的还多余利，所以答案选择A，批判性的。
37. 【答案】[C] keep a leading position in liberal education
【解析】细节题。根据自然段定位原则，36题在第一段出题，38题在第三段出题，那37题在第二段出题的可能性就很大。同时题干定位”Influential figures in the Congress”与“leading congressional Democrats and Republicans”同义替换。定位的答案是asking that it identify actions that could be taken by "federal, state and ….., individual benefactors and others" to "asking that it identify actions that could be taken by "federal, state and local governments, universities, foundations, educators, individual benefactors and others" to "maintain national excellence in humanities and social scientific scholarship and education. “In humanities and social scientific scholarship and education. “也就是说答案重点在maintain national excellence 刚好与选项C 中的leading position 进行同义替换。ABD与文章不符合。
38.【答案】[C] the application of emerging technologies
【解析】推理题。Suggest 是推理题的标志。先化选项关键词，发现选项A是讲American history选项B; 是讲theoretical subjects;选项C]emerging technologies;选项Dfunding foreign languages。返回原文定位的时候，A 选项中的“exclusive 排外”并没有在“stresses the study of history and government, particularly American history and American government;”这句话中体现。B选项中的理论学科没有定位点。D选项与原文“increased funding for teachers”以及“greater study of foreign languages,”不符。属于张冠李戴。“encourages the use of new digital technologies.”与选项C 同义替换。
39.【答案】[B] cautious about intellectual investigation
【解析】属于推理题。Implies是推理题的标志。同时根据提题干定位第五段，找professor. “professors routinely treat the progressive interpretation of history and progressive public policy as the proper subject of study while portraying conservative or classical liberal ideas―such as free markets, self-reliance ―as falling outside the boundaries of routine, and sometimes legitimate, intellectual investigation.”A 选项中的free markets前面的修饰词语是conservative or liberal ideas 没有体现A 选项中的supportive。C选项中的conservative 与文中progressive public policy 不符合。D选项中biased 没有体现，故排除。所以选B。
40.【答案】[B] Illiberal Education and “The Heart of the Matter”
【解析】主旨大意题。先看其他题题干，我们锁定关键词是report ，而report 就是“the heart of the matter “ 故排除C和D.而我们看A 发现文章并没有讲如何抓住“问题核心”的各个方法。排除A，选择B

Part B
解析：本文选自发表于2003年The International History Project的文章，题目为Archeology.
41. 【答案】[C]
【解析】此题是首段，所以需要找寻综述性的段落。其中A和E选项是给出的，所以只需从余下选项进行选择。B选项中有another，所以不会是第一段。E选项中代词their没有指代对象。F中有however,也不会是第一段。因此，只留下C和D选项。在C选项最后一句提到survey和test sample也很重要。而在D选项开头就提到了survey,而且整段都是，由此可看出D是对C的分述。所以C是首段。
42.【答案】[F]
【解析】此题排在A项之后，所以内容上应该是衔接的。A项主要谈论的是大部分考古地点是通过仔细搜寻之后找到的，而其他的很多是被偶然发现的，接着举了一些例子。接下来在看各段首句的时候，发现F项中提到大部分考古地点是被考古学家们特意寻找发现的，和A提到的偶然发现意思相反，所以F正确。
43.【答案】[G]
【解析】此题排在E项之后。E选项最后一句提到天空的搜寻，而在G选项的开头提到地面搜寻，正好形成对应，所以为正确答案。
44. 【答案】[D]
【解析】此时，只留下B和D选项。其中B选项开头提到了in another case,所以前面一段一定要提到in one case, 而D选项中有in one case.所以，D选项在前。
45. 【答案】[B]
【解析】根据上面的分析，此题只能选B。 
Part C
46. It is also the reason why when we try to describe music with words, all we can do is articulate our reactions to it, and not grasp music itself.
【句型分析】本句主句主干为it is the reason，why引导定语从句，修饰the reason。定语从句的主干是all we can do is articulate our reactions and not grasp music itself，其表语是不定式短语，由于主语中含有do，不定式符号to省略：articulate our reactions and not grasp music itself。our reactions之后to it为其定语，it指代music。定语从句中还包含when引导的时间状语从句。
【翻译要点】①本句主干的主句是主系表结构，reason后why引导的定语从句较长，翻译时可以与主干部分结合，调整表达为：这也就是为什么….。
②定语从句中，when引导时间状语从句，其中with words做状语，翻译时需调整语序到其修饰的to describe之前，可以表达为“当我们尝试用语言来描述音乐时”。定语从句的主干顺译即可，其中reaction根据语境，可以翻译为“感受”，其定语to it在表达时前置，it指代还原为“音乐”，则可以翻译为“所有我们能做的，就是明确表达我们对于音乐的感受”，或者调整表达为“我们只能明确表达我们对于音乐的感受”。and之后，grasp依据语境，需要翻译为“理解”。
【译文总结】这也是为什么当我们试图用语言来描述音乐时，我们只能明确表达我们对于音乐的感受，而不能完全理解音乐本身。

47. By all accounts he was a freethinking person, and a courageous one, and I find courage an essential quality for the understanding, let alone the performance, of his works.
【句型分析】本句为并列句。第一个分句he was a freethinking person, and a courageous one，句首by all accounts为固定搭配，意思是“根据各方面说”。第二个分句的主干为I find courage an essential quality，其中宾语为courage，而an essential quality是宾语补足语。quality后介词短语for the understanding of his work为其定语，其中还包含一个插入结构let alone the performance。
【翻译要点】① 第一个分句结构比较简单，句首固定搭配by all accounts，可以调整表达，翻译为“据大家所说”。主干顺译即可，其中he指代“贝多芬”，one指代person。这一部分可以翻译为“贝多芬是个思想自由、充满勇气的人”。
②第二个分句，主干为“我发现勇气是一个关键品质”，quality后为其定语for the understanding of his work，其中the understanding of his work意思为“对于其作品的理解”，做词性转化后，可以表达为“理解其作品”，这个介词短语需要调整语序前置于quality，可以翻译为“理解他作品的关键品质”，则第二个分句可以表达为“我发现勇气，是理解他作品的关键品质”。还可以调整表达为“我发现勇气这一品质，是理解他作品的关键”。
③在定语for the understanding of his work中的插入成分，在逻辑上let alone并列the understanding和the performance，二者共用定语of his works，顺译句末即可：更不必说是演出其作品的关键品质。
【译文总结】人们普遍认为，他(贝多芬)是个思想自由、充满勇气的人，我发现勇气这一品质，是理解他作品的关键，更不必说是演出其作品的关键。

48. Beethoven’s habit of increasing the volume with an extreme intensity and then abruptly following it with a sudden soft passage was only rarely used by composers before him.
【句型分析】本句主干为Beethoven’s habit was used by composers before him。本句的谓语为被动语态，主语habit后介词短语of increasing the volume with an extreme intensity and then abruptly following it with a sudden soft passage为其定语，是由介词of与and并列的两个动名词短语increasing the volume with an extreme intensity 和then abruptly following it with a sudden soft passage构成。
【翻译要点】①本句主干较为简单，但是主语habit后有很长的后置定语：Habit of increasing the volume…，其中“habit”可以词性转换为动词“习惯”，而中文常常先表达次要信息，则这一部分可以翻译一句话“贝多芬习惯增加…”，置于句首。第一个动名词短语中，with an extreme intensity为状语，表达时需调整语序到其修饰的increasing the volume前，根据语境，volume意思为“音量”，则increasing可以翻译为“增高”。这一部分可以翻译为“最大限度来逐渐增高音量”。第二个动名词短语then abruptly following it with a sudden soft passage，状语with a sudden soft passage需调整到following it前表达，其中passage根据语境，意思为“乐段”。则这一部分可以表达为“然后突然跟上轻柔的乐段”。整合本句主语与其定语，可以翻译为“贝多芬习惯最大限度来逐渐增高音量，然后突然跟上轻柔的乐段”。
②本句主干意思为“在他之前，作曲家很少使用贝多芬的习惯”。中文语义重心在后，将本部分翻译在句末即可。由于前句译文已经提到这种习惯，则这部分可以表达为“在他之前，作曲家很少使用这种习惯”，结合语境还可以表达为“在他之前，作曲家很少使用这种方式”，或者“在他之前，只有极个别作曲家会使用这种方式”。
【译文总结】贝多芬习惯最大限度来逐渐增高音量，然后突然跟上轻柔的乐段，在他之前，作曲家很少使用这种方式。

49) Especially significant was his view of freedom, which, for him, was associated with the rights and responsibilities of the individual: he advocated freedom of thought and of personal expression.
【句型分析】本句为完全倒装，主句的主干是his view of freedom was Especially significant。
his view of freedom后为which引导的非限定性定语从句，修饰freedom，关系代词which在定语从句中作主语。of the individual修饰the rights and responsibilities，冒号后进行解释说明。
【翻译要点】
① 本句主干为完全倒装，但是在翻译时，顺译即可，其中his指代“贝多芬的”，主干可以表达为：尤为重要的是，他(贝多芬)对于自由的看法….。
② which引导英语从句，修饰freedom，表达时翻译成另一句话“对于他而言，这种自由是与个人的权利和责任联系起来的”，其中for him还可以调整表达为“他认为”。
③冒号后进行解释，可以翻译为：他倡导思想自由和个人言论自由。
【译文总结】尤为重要的是贝多芬对于自由的看法，他认为，这种自由是与个人的权利和责任联系起来的：他倡导思想自由和个人言论自由。

50. One could interpret much of the work of Beethoven by saying that suffering is inevitable, but the courage to fight it renders life worth living.
【句型分析】本句主句主干为One could interpret much of the work of Beethoven，之后by saying that suffering is inevitable, but the courage to fight it renders life worth living为状语，修饰interpret。其中that引导宾语从句suffering is inevitable, but the courage to fight it renders life worth living，为saying的宾语，宾语从句中it指代suffering。
【翻译要点】①本句主语one，可以翻译为“人们”或者“我们”。主干可以翻译为“我们可以解释贝多芬的大部分作品”。
②主干之后的状语，可以翻译为“通过说痛苦是无法避免的，但是与之相抗争的勇气使得生命值得继续。”
③整合主干，可以表达为“我们可以这样解释贝多芬的大部分作品：苦难是不可避免的，但是与痛苦抗争的勇气使得生命值得继续。”
【译文总结】我们可以这样解释贝多芬的大部分作品：苦难是不可避免的，但是与痛苦抗争的勇气使得生命值得继续。

Section III Writing
Part A
Dear Mr. President,
I am writing to put forward some suggestions concerning the ways to improve student’s physical condition in your university. My proposals are as the following.
First and foremost, I propose that we should take advantages of physical education classes on our campus, and not only educate students to realize the significance of the classes, but also to encourage students to take an active part in the classes. More importantly, we should attach importance to the role played by extra-curricular activates. For example, we could plan and organize a large number of such ball games as football games, basketball games and so on. 
It’s my honor to share my opinions concerned with you. If you could take my advice into consideration, I will be highly grateful.
                                           Sincerely yours,
                                               Li Ming

Part B
As is shown above, in the first picture, along the road walked a young and vigorous mother, leading her girl hand in hand, with smile on her face three decades ago, while nowadays the daughter in the prime of her life guided her aged mother through the road arm in arm in the second picture. Recently there is a heated discussion about these pictures on Wei bo. Simple as they are, the meaning behind is as deep as ocean. 
The meaningful drawing mirrors a common phenomenon in contemporary society that there is the positive influence of fealty. It is universally acknowledged that supporting the aged is the responsibility of the sons and daughters of the Chinese people. First of all, emphases should be given to the cultivation of young children on respecting and loving the elders, which is undoubtedly an essential factor of this phenomenon. In addition, our government should take joint efforts to carry out effective measures on how to punish those who abuse the elders. Last but not the least, every individuals should keep deep in mind that it is the elders that contributed a lot to the rapid development of our society.
Given all the above arguments, I take the attitude that, first of all, we should show filial piety to parents who bring us to maturity. More importantly, the public should embrace and promote the awareness of filial duty which is importance for a more active and healthy society. In conclusion, filial piety, as a traditional Chinese virtue, is indispensable for us living a more valuable and fulfilling life.

　　Text 1
　　In the 2006 film version of The Devil Wears Prada, Miranda Priestly, played by Meryl Streep, scold her unattractive assistant for imagining that high fashion doesn’t affect her. Priestly explains how the deep blue color of the assistant’s sweater descended over the years from fashion shows to department stores and to the bargain bin in which the poor girl doubtless found her garment.
　　This top-down conception of the fashion business couldn’t be more out of date or at odds with feverish world described in Overdressed, Elizabeth Cline’s three-year indictment of “fast fashion”. In the last decades or so, advances in technology have allowed mass-market labels such as Zara, H&M, and Uniqlo to react to trends more quickly and anticipate demand more precisely. Quckier turnrounds mean less wasted inventory, more frequent releases, and more profit. Those labels encourage style-conscious consumers to see clothes as disposal―― meant to last only a wash or two, although they don’t advertise that――and to renew their wardrobe every few weeks. By offering on-trend items at dirt-cheap prices, Cline argues, these brands have hijacked fashion cycles, shaking all industry long accustomed to a seasonal pace.
　　The victims of this revolution, of course, are not limited to designers. For H&M to offer a 5.95 knit miniskirt in all its 2300-plus stores around the world, it must rely on low-wage, overseas labor, order in volumes that strain natural resources, and use massive amount of harmful chemicals.
　　Overdressed is the fashion world’s answer to consumer activist bestsellers like Michael Pollan’s The Omnivore’s Dilemma. Mass-produced clothing, like fast food, fills a hunger and need, yet is non-durable, and wasteful,” Cline argues, Americans, she finds, buy roughly 20 billion garments a year――about 64 items per person――and no matter how much they give away, this excess leads to waste.
Towards the end of Overdressed, Cline introduced her ideal, a Brooklyn woman named SKB, who, since 2008 has make all of her own clothes――and beautifully. But as Cline is the first to note, it took Beaumont decades to perfect her craft; her example, can’t be knocked off.
　　Though several fast-fashion companies have made efforts to curb their impact on labor and the environment――including H&M, with its green Conscious Collection Line――Cline believes lasting-change can only be effected by the customer. She exhibits the idealism common to many advocates of sustainability, be it in food or in energy. Vanity is a constant; people will only start shopping more sustainably when they can’t afford to it.
　　21. Priestly criticizes her assistant for her
　　[A] poor bargaining skill.
　　[B] insensitivity to fashion.
　　[C] obsession with high fashion.
　　[D]lack of imagination.
　　22. According to Cline, mass-maket labels urge consumers to
　　[A] combat unnecessary waste.
　　[B] shut out the feverish fashion world.
　　[C] resist the influence of advertisements.
　　[D] shop for their garments more frequently.
　　23. The word “indictment” (Line 3, Para.2) is closest in meaning to
　　[A] accusation.
　　[B] enthusiasm.
　　[C] indifference.
　　[D] tolerance.
　　24. Which of the following can be inferred from the lase paragraph?
　　[A] Vanity has more often been found in idealists.
　　[B] The fast-fashion industry ignores sustainability.
　　[C] People are more interested in unaffordable garments.
　　[D] Pricing is vital to environment-friendly purchasing.
　　25. What is the subject of the text?
　　[A] Satire on an extravagant lifestyle.
　　[B] Challenge to a high-fashion myth.
　　[C] Criticism of the fast-fashion industry.
　　[D] Exposure of a mass-market secret.

　　An old saying has it that half of all advertising budgets are wasted-the trouble is, no one knows which half . In the internet age, at least in theory ,this fraction can be much reduced . By watching what people search for, click on and say online, companies can aim “behavioural” ads at those most likely to buy.
　　In the past couple of weeks a quarrel has illustrated the value to advertisers of such fine-grained information: Should advertisers assume that people are happy to be tracked and sent behavioural ads? Or should they have explicit permission?
In December 2010 America's Federal Trade Cornmission (FTC) proposed adding a "do not track "(DNT) option to internet browsers ,so that users could tell adwertisers that they did not want to be followed .Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Apple's Safari both offer DNT ;Google's Chrome is due to do so this year. In February the FTC and Digltal Adwertising Alliance (DAA) agreed that the industry would get cracking on responging to DNT requests.
　　On May 31st Microsoft Set off the row: It said that Internet Explorer 10,the version due to appear windows 8, would have DNT as a default.
　　It is not yet clear how advertisers will respond. Geting a DNT signal does not oblige anyone to stop tracking, although some companies have promised to do so. Unable to tell whether someone really objects to behavioural ads or whether they are sticking with Microsoft’s default, some may ignore a DNT signal and press on anyway.
　　Also unclear is why Microsoft has gone it alone. Atter all, it has an ad business too, which it says will comply with DNT requests, though it is still working out how. If it is trying to upset Google, which relies almost wholly on default will become the norm. DNT does not seem an obviously huge selling point for windows 8-though the firm has compared some of its other products favourably with Google's on that count before. Brendon Lynch, Microsoft's chief privacy officer, bloggde:"we believe consumers should have more control." Could it really be that simple?
　　26. It is suggested in paragraph 1 that “behavioural” ads help advertisers to:
　　[A] ease competition among themselves

　　27. “The industry” (Line 6,Para.3) refers to:
　　[A] online advertisers
　　[B] e-commerce conductors
　　[C] digital information analysis
　　[D]internet browser developers
　　28. Bob Liodice holds that setting DNT as a default
　　[A] many cut the number of junk ads
　　[B] fails to affect the ad industry
　　[C] will not benefit consumers
　　[D]goes against human nature
　　29. which of the following is ture according to Paragraph.6?
　　[A] DNT may not serve its intended purpose
　　[B] Advertisers are willing to implement DNT
[C] DNT is losing its popularity among consumers

　　[A] indulgence
　　[B] understanding
　　[C] appreciaction
　　[D] skepticism
　
　Text 3
　　Up until a few decades ago, our visions of the future were largely - though by no means uniformly - glowingly positive. Science and technology would cure all the ills of humanity, leading to lives of fulfillment and opportunity for all.
　　Now utopia has grown unfashionable, as we have gained a deeper appreciation of the range of threats facing us, from asteroid strike to epidemic flu and to climate change. You might even be tempted to assume that humanity has little future to look forward to.
　　But such gloominess is misplaced. The fossil record shows that many species have endured for millions of years - so why shouldn't we? Take a broader look at our species' place in the universe, and it becomes clear that we have an excellent chance of surviving for tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of years . Look up Homo sapiens in the "Red List" of threatened species of the International Union for the Conversation of Nature (IUCN) ,and you will read: "Listed as Least Concern as the species is very widely distributed, adaptable, currently increasing, and there are no major threats resulting in an overall population decline."
　　So what does our deep future hold? A growing number of researchers and organisations are now thinking seriously about that question. For example, the Long Now Foundation has its flagship project a medical clock that is designed to still be marking time thousands of years hence .
　　Perhaps willfully , it may be easier to think about such lengthy timescales than about the more immediate future. The potential evolution of today's technology, and its social consequences, is dazzlingly complicated, and it's perhaps best left to science fiction writers and futurologists to explore the many possibilities we can envisage. That's one reason why we have launched Arc, a new publication dedicated to the near future.
　　But take a longer view and there is a surprising amount that we can say with considerable assurance. As so often, the past holds the key to the future: we have now identified enough of the long-term patterns shaping the history of the planet, and our species, to make evidence-based forecasts about the situations in which our descendants will find themselves.
This long perspective makes the pessimistic view of our prospects seem more likely to be a passing fad. To be sure, the future is not all rosy. But we are now knowledgeable enough to reduce many of the risks that threatened the existence of earlier humans, and to improve the lot of those to come.
　　31. Our vision of the future used to be inspired by
　　[A] our desire for lives of fulfillment
　　[B] our faith in science and technology
　　[C] our awareness of potential risks
　　[D] our belief in equal opportunity
　　32. The IUCN’s “Red List” suggest that human being are
　　[A] a sustained species
　　[B] a threaten to the environment
　　[C] the world’s dominant power
　　[D] a misplaced race
　　33. Which of the following is true according to Paragraph 5?
　　[A] Arc helps limit the scope of futurological studies.
　　[B] Technology offers solutions to social problem.
　　[C] The interest in science fiction is on the rise.
　　[D] Our Immediate future is hard to conceive.
　　34. To ensure the future of mankind, it is crucial to
　　[A] explore our planet’s abundant resources
　　[B] adopt an optimistic view of the world
　　[C] draw on our experience from the past
　　[D] curb our ambition to reshape history
　　35. Which of the following would be the best title for the text?
　　[A] Uncertainty about Our Future
　　[B] Evolution of the Human Species
　　[C] The Ever-bright Prospects of Mankind
　　[D] Science, Technology and Humanity
　
　Text 4
　　On a five to three vote, the Supreme Court knocked out much of Arizona’s immigration law Monday-a modest policy victory for the Obama Administration. But on the more important matter of the Constitution,the decision was an 8-0 defeat for the Administration’s effort to upset the balance of power between the federal government and the states.
　　In Arizona v. United States, the majority overturned three of the four contested provisions of Arizona’s controversial plan to have state and local police enforce federal immigration law. The Constitutional principles that Washington alone has the power to “establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization ”and that federal laws precede state laws are noncontroversial . Arizona had attempted to fashion state policies that ran parallel to the existing federal ones.
Justice Anthony Kennedy, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and the Court’s liberals, ruled that the state flew too close to the federal sun. On the overturned provisions the majority held the congress had deliberately “occupied the field” and Arizona had thus intruded on the federal’s privileged powers.
　　However,the Justices said that Arizona police would be allowed to verify the legal status of people who come in contact with law enforcement.That’s because Congress has always envisioned joint federal-state immigration enforcement and explicitly encourages state officers to share information and cooperate with federal colleagues.
　　Two of the three objecting Justice-Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas-agreed with this Constitutional logic but disagreed about which Arizona rules conflicted with the federal statute.The only major objection came from Justice Antonin Scalia,who offered an even more robust defense of state privileges going back to the alien and Sedition Acts.
　　The 8-0 objection to President Obama turns on what Justice Samuel Alito describes in his objection as “a shocking assertion assertion of federal executive power”.The White House argued that Arizona’s laws conflicted with its enforcement priorities,even if state laws complied with federal statutes to the letter.In effect, the White House claimed that it could invalidate any otherwise legitimate state law that it disagrees with .
　　Some powers do belong exclusively to the federal government, and control of citizenship and the borders is among them. But if Congress wanted to prevent states from using their own resources to check immigration status, it could. It never did so. The administration was in essence asserting that because it didn’t want to carry out Congress’s immigration wishes, no state should be allowed to do so either. Every Justice rightly rejected this remarkable claim.
　　36. Three provisions of Arizona’s plan were overturned because they
　　[A] deprived the federal police of Constitutional powers.
　　[B] disturbed the power balance between different states.
　　[C] overstepped the authority of federal immigration law.
　　[D] contradicted both the federal and state policies.
　　37. On which of the following did the Justices agree,according to Paragraph4?
　　[A] Federal officers’ duty to withhold immigrants’information.
[B] States’ independence from federal immigration law.
　　[C] States’ legitimate role in immigration enforcement.
　　[D] Congress’s intervention in immigration enforcement.
　　38. It can be inferred from Paragraph 5 that the Alien and Sedition Acts
　　[A] violated the Constitution.
　　[B] undermined the states’ interests.
　　[C] supported the federal statute.
　　[D] stood in favor of the states.
　　39. The White House claims that its power of enforcement
　　[A] outweighs that held by the states.
　　[B] is dependent on the states’ support.
　　[C] is established by federal statutes.
　　[D] rarely goes against state laws.
　　40. What can be learned from the last paragraph?
　　[A] Immigration issues are usually decided by Congress.
　　[B] Justices intended to check the power of the Administrstion.
　　[C] Justices wanted to strengthen its coordination with Congress.
　　[D] The Administration is dominant over immigration issues.

　　The social sciences are flourishing.As of 2005,there were almost half a million professional social scientists from all fields in the world, working both inside and outside academia. According to the World Social Science Report 2010,the number of social-science students worldwide has swollen by about 11% every year since 2000.
　　Yet this enormous resource in not contributing enough to today’s global challenges including climate change, security,sustainable development and health.(41)______Humanity has the necessary agro-technological tools to eradicate hunger , from genetically engineered crops to arificial fertilizers . Here , too, the problems are social: the organization and distribution of food, wealth and prosperity.
　　(42)____This is a shame―the community should be grasping the opportunity to raise its influence in the real world. To paraphrase the great social scientist Joseph Schumpeter:there is no radical innovation without creative destruction .
Today ,the social sciences are largely focused on disciplinary problems and internal scholarly debates,rather than on topics with external impact.
　　Analyses reveal that the number of papers including the keywords “environmental changed” or “climate change” have increased rapidly since 2004,(43)____
　　When social scientists do tackle practical issues ,their scope is often local:Belgium is interested mainly in the effects of poverty on Belgium for example .And whether the community’s work contributes much to an overall accumulation of knowledge is doubtful.
　　The problem is not necessarily the amount of available funding (44)____this is an adequate amount so long as it is aimed in the right direction. Social scientists who complain about a lack of funding should not expect more in today’s economic climate.
　　The trick is to direct these funds better.The European Union Framework funding programs have long had a category specifically targeted at social scientists.This year,it was proposed that system be changed:Horizon 2020,a new program to be enacted in 2014,would not have such a category ,This has resulted in protests from social scientists.But the intention is not to neglect social science ; rather ,the complete opposite.(45)____That should create more collaborative endeavors and help to develop projects aimed directly at solving global problems.
　　[A] It could be that we are evolving two communities of social
　　scientists:one that is discipline-oriented and publishing in highly
　　specialized journals,and one that is problem-oriented and publishing
　　elsewhere,such as policy briefs.
　　[B] However,the numbers are still small:in 2010,about 1,600 of the
　　100,000 social-sciences papers published globally included one of these
　　Keywords.
　　[C] the idea is to force social to integrate their work with other categories, including health and demographic change food security, marine research and the bio-economy, clear, efficient energy; and inclusive, innovative and secure societies.
　　[D] the solution is to change the mindset of the academic community, and what it considers to be its main goal. Global challenges and social innovation ought to receive much more attention from scientists, especially the young ones.
　　[E] These issues all have root causes in human behavior . all require behavioral change and social innovations , as well as technological development . Stemming climate change , for example , is as much about changing consumption patterns and promoting tax acceptance as it is about developing clean energy.
[F] Despite these factors , many social scientists seem reluctant to tackle such problems . And in Europe , some are up in arms over a proposal to drop a specific funding category for social-science research and to integrate it within cross-cutting topics of sustainable development .
　　[G] During the late 1990s , national spending on social sciences and the humanities as a percentage of all research and development funds-including government, higher education, non-profit and corporate -varied from around 4% to 25%; in most European nations , it is about 15%.

　　It is speculated that gardens arise from a basic need in the individuals who made them: the need for creative expression. There is no doubt that gardens evidence an impossible urge to create, express, fashion, and beautify and that self-expression is a basic human urge; (46) Yet when one looks at the photographs of the garden created by the homeless, it strikes one that , for all their diversity of styles, these gardens speak os various other fundamental urges, beyond that of decoration and creative expression.
　　One of these urges had to do with creating a state of peace in the midst of turbulence, a “still point of the turning world,” to borrow a phrase from T. S. Eliot. (47)A sacred place of peace, however crude it may be, is a distinctly human need, as opposed to shelter, which is a distinctly animal need. This distinction is so much so that where the latter is lacking, as it is for these unlikely gardens, the foemer becomes all the more urgent. Composure is a state of mind made possible by the structuring of one’s relation to one’s environment. (48) The gardens of the homeless which are in effect homeless gardens introduce from into an urban environment where it either didn’t exist or was not discernible as such. In so doing they give composure to a segment of the inarticulate environment in which they take their stand.
　　Another urge or need that these gardens appear to respond to, or to arise from is so intrinsic that we are barely ever conscious of its abiding claims on us. When we are deprived of green, of plants, of trees, (49)most of us give into a demoralization of spirit which we usually blame on some psychological conditions, until one day we find ourselves in garden and feel the expression vanish as if by magic. In most of the homeless gardens of New York City the actual cultivation of plants is unfeasible, yet even so the compositions often seem to represent attempts to call arrangement of materials, an institution of colors, small pool of water, and a frequent presence of petals or leaves as well as of stuffed animals. On display here are various fantasy elements whose reference, at some basic level, seems to be the natural world. (50)It is this implicit or explicit reference to nature that fully justifies the use of word garden though in a “liberated” sense, to describe these synthetic constructions. In them we can see biophilia- a yearning for contact with nonhuman life-assuming uncanny representational forms.

　　   【解析】 which are unbiased 这个定语从句做插入语修饰 judgment。这句话的意思是“通过XXX因素作出公正判决的能力”，由此可以排除[A] 和 [B]。做这一题时，我们需要理解第一句话，给我们提供了一个大的背景和条件。第一句话说“人们不擅长利用背景信息作决定”，所以可以推出这儿并不是“通过关键信息”来做出公正的判决，而是通过其它一些信息，如外部的信息，作出判决。根据上下文意思，可以推出 [D] 为正确答案。
　　3.【答案】 [C]
　　  【考点分析】 上下文语义和固定搭配
　　  【解析】 big picture 是一个固定搭配，指(事情的)主要部分;重点，故选[A]。其它词语与big 搭配，均没有这层意思。
　　4. 【答案】 [A]
　　   【考点分析】 逻辑衔接题
　　   【解析】 根据上下文的逻辑关系判断，在提出一个观点之后，接下来就是进行例证。选项中只有[A] 表示“例如”，符合这一逻辑关系，故选[A]。[B]表示“平均”的意思;[C]为“大体上，原则上”;[D] 为“首先”，均不符合。

　　6. 【答案】 [B]
　　   【考点分析】 介词搭配
　　   【解析】 soft on sb/sth 是一个固定搭配词组，表示“对某人/某事态度偏软，不够严厉”的意思，故选[B]。
　　7.【答案】A
　　  【考点分析】 逻辑衔接题
　　  【解析】 前半句含义是“一个担心自己会犯罪行为上表现的过分软弱的法官可能会判人入狱”，后半句含义是“当天他已经判五到六个人缓刑”两句间的逻辑关系明显为假设。A if 表示假设“如果”。B until “直到。。。才。。。”。C though “然而”，表转折。D unless “除非”，表让步。前半句是结果主句，后半句是一个假设条件，所以选C
8.【答案】 D。
【考点分析】 上下文语义及动词辨析
　　  【解析】 本句话是说要进行试验来验证观点。空格后的名词idea作宾语，对决定动词十分关键。

10.【答案】 A。
【考点分析】 后置定语
　　   【解析】 本句意为测试中随机选出的其他申请者。A chosen “选出”。B stupid “笨的”。C found “发现”。D identified “识别”。只有A 选项和申请者搭配意为选出来的申请者，符合语境。
11.【答案】 D。
【考点分析】 逻辑衔接题
　　   【解析】 后半句开头的but已经暗示了下文的连接词。内容上前半句意为一个申请者的面试成功和其他申请者没有关系，后半句意为西蒙森怀疑事实。明显是转折关系。A exceptional “例外的”。B defensible “可防御的”。C replaceable “可替换的”。D otherwise “相反的”。只有D项可以表转折关系，所以选D。
12. 【答案】 C。
【考点分析】 后置定语
　　    【解析】 本句前半句是说西蒙森研究了面试者的结果，后半句含义是招生办官员。所以这里应该是招生办官员举行面试，后半句做后置定语。A inspire “鼓舞”。B expressed “表达”。C conducted “举行”。D secured “保护”。所以结合上下文可以得出只有C项符合语境。

　　14.【答案】 [D]
　　   【解析】固定搭配。 题干This scale 14 numerous factors into consideration. 空格处需要动词一个。因为后面有into consideration. 所以选took. Take into consideration 是把什么考虑在内的意思。
　　15.【答案】 [B]
　　   【解析】本题考查逻辑关系，通过上下文应该选择一个表顺承先后顺序的词，只有B项then合适。
　　16. 【答案】 [C]
　　    【考点分析】 上下文语义和逻辑关系
　　    【解析】 这句话 which 引导一个定语从句，修饰 exam，考试都有一个总分，这句话的意思是说“以800分计算的标准测试”，可以排除[A]、[B]和 [D]选项。mark 表示“得分”，符合原文意思，故选[C]。
　　17. 【答案】 [A]
【考点分析】 上下文语义和逻辑关系
　　    【解析】 根据词语的意思和搭配，可以排除 [C] 和 [D] 选项。这题的选择必须与后面一题联系起来进行选择，这句话说“前面候选者的分数比XXX的候选者高0.75分”，则“下一个候选者则XXX”，由此可知，“前面的候选者”肯定不能是比他后面的人分数高，排除[B]。[A] 选项符合上下文逻辑关系，故选[A]。
18. 【答案】C. 
【解析】根据上下文意思，是一种up和down 的趋势，17空前面是up趋势，所以18谓语动词应该选“下降”的趋势的动词，A,B,C,D之中明显的表下降的是B项， drop相对于前面的high。

Section Ⅱ Reading Comprehension
Part A
Text 1
21.【答案】B insensitivity to fashion.
【解析】事实细节题。根据题干，首先定位到首段。由文章第一句后半句“…scolds her unattractive assistant for imagining that high fashion doesn’t affect her.”意思是：“……批评她没有魅力的助理，因为助理认为高级时尚对她的生活影响不大”。可知criticize是对scolds的同义替换，B项中的“insensitivity to fashion”是“imagining that high fashion doesn’t affect her.”的同义替换。所以B项为正确答案。A项在文中并未提及，属于无中生有。C项和D项是对文章第一句的曲解。
22.【答案】D shop for their garments more frequently.
【解析】事实细节题。根据题干，首先定位到第二段。由倒数第二句“these labels encourage style-conscious consumers to see clothes as disposable, ……, and to renew their wardrobe every few weeks.”意思是“这些商标(畅销商标)促使有时尚意识的消费者将服装看成是用完就可以丢弃的，……，并且每周更新他们的衣橱。”D选项 “shop for their garments more frequently”的意思是“更加频繁地购买服装”，正好是“renew their wardrobe every few weeks”的同义替换。A，B，C项均属于无中生有项。
23.【答案】A accusation.
【解析】词义题。题干中需要猜测词义的单词出现在第二段的第一句“……the feverish world described in Overdressed, Elizabeth Cline’s three-year indictment of ‘fast fashion’”。再结合选项可知，“indictment”是Elizabeth Cline对“快时尚”的一种态度。因此，解答此题的关键在于联系上下文语境，找到Elizabeth Cline对“快时尚”的态度。由第二段最后一句“By offering on-trend items at dirt-cheap prices, Cline argues, these brands have hijacked fashion cycles, shaking an industry long accustomed to a seasonal pace.”，意思是“Cline说，通过以特别低的价格销售潮流物品，这些品牌破坏了潮流周期，动摇了这个长久以来习惯于季节周期的产业”。由“hijack”和“shaking”可知，Cline对“快时尚”应该是持否定态度的，所以选项A“accusation (谴责)”是正确选项。
24.【答案】D pricing is vital to environmental-friendly purchasing.
【解析】推理判断题。根据题干，可定位到最后一段。解题关键在于“Vanity is a constant; people will only start shopping more sustainably when they can’t afford not to”，意思是“每个人都很虚荣，这很常见。但消费者付不起太多东西的时候，他们才会以更加可持续的方式去购物。”这句的关键词是“afford”和“shop more sustainably”，对应于D项中的“pricing”和“environmental-friendly purchasing”。A项对于本段的曲解。B项说的是“忽视环境的可持续发展”，与文中“several fast-fashion companies have made efforts to curb their impact on labor and the environment…”(一些时尚服饰公司已经做出努力减少对劳动力和环境)意思相悖。C项文中未提及。
25.【答案】C criticism of the fast-fashion industry.
【解析】主旨大意题。此题考查对全文主旨大意的准确归纳。从整个文章脉络来看，文章的第一段用事例引入，第二段讲到文章的主题“快时尚”，并指出它破坏了时尚周期，动摇了时尚产业。第三四段指出“快时尚”这种变革的弊端，比如：给自然资源造成压力、使用大量有害的化学物质、浪费现象。最后两段提到针对“快时尚”的不良影响，可以采取的解决办法。由此可知，C项统领全文，为正确答案。A, B,D项都不是文章所论述的中心主题。

Text 2
26.【答案】B lower their operational costs
【解析】此题考查考生对文章细节信息的把握能力。此类题目的解题关键在于根据题干信息定位，本题的“Paragraph 1”，“behavioural”即为定位信息。
根据文章第一段第二句“this fraction can be much reduced”在互联网时代，至少在理论上，被浪费的那一部分资金中，有很多都可以节省下来。对应文章“half of all advertising budgets are wasted”。故B项“降低运营成本”是文章的同义改写。ABD项文章均为提到。
27. 【答案】D internet browser developers
【解析】此题考查考生对文章细节信息的把握能力。根据题干中已经给出了具体信息点“The industry”应回第三段定位。
　　根据题干信息“the industry”可推测the为前文指代，所以应当定位到该句之前，文章内容为：“摩斯拉(Mozilla)的火狐(Firefox)、微软(Microsoft)的IE(Internet Explorer)及苹果的浏览器Safari都有“不允许跟踪”选项;今年，谷歌也将在Chrome中加入这一功能”，由此可推断出选项D“网络浏览器开发商”为正确选项。
28.【答案】Cwill not benefit consumers
【解析】此题考查考生对文章细节信息的把握能力。结合题干中所给出的人名“Bob Liodice”以及专有名词DNT和“default”可回文章定位到第五段。
　文章中Bob Liodice称，“如果广告商不能收集有关用户偏好的信息，那么这对于消费者来说将更为不利。”原文中“consumers will be worse off”对应C选项“will not benefit consumers”，“将对消费者不利”，因此C应为正确答案。A项与原文相反，“垃圾广告”不是减少而是增加。B项“对广告业没有影响”以及D项“违背人性”均与文章不符。
29.【答案】A  DNT may not serve its intended purpose
【解析】此题考查考生对文章的细节信息的把握能力，关键在于定位和辨别细节信息。
　　根据题干信息提示，我们不难定位到文章第六段最后一句的后半部分“…some may ignore a DNT signal and press on anyway.” 一些公司可能忽略“不允许跟踪”信号，继续记录用户的在线行为。所以推知"不允许跟踪"可能不会起到预期的作用。选项B广告商很乐意实行“不允许跟踪”与本段第一句话“It is not yet clear how advertisers will respond. 广告商们会对此作何反应仍不清楚”不符。选项C"不允许跟踪"已经不再收到消费者的欢迎与本段第一句和最后一句内容“…some may ignore a DNT signal and press on anyway.” 不符;选项C广告商被迫提供"行为"广告与文中“Getting a DNT signal does not oblige anyone to stop tracking…”不相符。
30.【答案】Dskepticism
【解析】此题考查考生对作者观点态度的把握。根据自然段定位法可定位到文章的最后一段。
　根据关键信息Brendon Lynch我们主要定位到文章最后一段的倒数第二句以及最后一句。Brendon Lynch“在博客中写道：‘我们认为用户应该有更大的话语权。’”紧接着最后一句“Could it really be that simple? 真的是这么简单吗?”体现了作者的态度。A项意为“纵容”;B项为““理解”之义;选项C为“感激”之义;D项为“怀疑”。因此只有D项符合作者本意，故为正确答案。
Text 3
31.【答案】 B our faith in science and technology
【解析】细节题。根据题干信息，our vision of the future used to定位为文章第一段。B选项为答案，我们的对未来的想象曾经被我们对于科技的信心所鼓舞。 A 选项错误原因为因果倒置，lives of fulfillment是由science and technololgy导致，与文章题干要求our vision of future 无关。C选项为无中生有，也未提到awareness of potential risks的概念。D选项equal opportunity为opportunity for all所有人都有相等的机会的曲解。
32.【答案】B a threaten to the environment
【解析】推理题。文章问题是“Red List”表明人类怎么是什么。根据关键词定位到文章的第三段。Look up Homo sapiens in the "Red List" of threatened species of the International Union for the Conversation of Nature (IUCN) ,and you will read….根据threatened species知道是被威胁的物种，同时后面的the Conversation of Nature知道是对自然的。那这个“threatened”被人类威胁就很明显。
33.【答案】 D Our Immediate future is hard to conceive.
【解析】判断题。 A 选项定位在it's perhaps best left to science fiction writers and futurologists to explore the many possibilities we can envisage. That's one reason why we have launched Arc, a new publication dedicated to the near future.这里根本就没有讲限制。这2句话是说要让科幻小说的作者和未来学家去探索我们能现象的可能性。.这里发表的Arc根本就没有讲限制。A 排除B讲科技，但是文章说完The potential evolution of today's technology, and its social consequences, is dazzlingly complicated,讲科技和它的社会意义。后面一句 and it's perhaps best…能看得到转折。文章也没有提到solution，也没有提到社会问题(social problem).
　　C 选项是说对科幻小说的兴趣在上升(on the rise)但是整段都没有说到这个趋势。D选项定位文章第一句话　Perhaps willfully , it may be easier to think about such lengthy timescales than about the more immediate future.从这句话能推测出immediate future是比漫长的时标更难的事情，也是更不易察觉的。
34.【答案】 C draw on our experience from the past
【解析】细节题。 定位的是future of the mankind ,文章第6段，同时有个很重要的标点符号冒号，说明the past holds the key to the future: 一直在点号之前都是这句话的具体解释。也就是说这句强调the past 的关键性，所以选择C。A项B项和D项都跟内容无关。
35. 【答案】A Uncertainty about Our Future
【解析】主旨题 文章最好的题目是A选项，对未来的不确定性。文章第一段讲过去人们对于未来的想象，第二，三段为对现在的看法。第四段至最后一段为对未来的不确定性。B选项为人类的演化，C选项为人类美好的前景，D选项科学，技术与人类不是文章的主旨 。顾答案为A。

36.【答案】C
【解析】此题考查考生对文章细节信息的把握能力
　根据题干中的关键词 three provisions of Arizona定位到文中第二段。第一句提到Arizona计划的三个部分被推翻是让州和地方警察实施联邦移民法律。这句话没有相对应选项，所以看到后面一句，意思是宪法的规则是毋庸置疑的，它认为华盛顿本身就有建立一个统一的自然化的规则的权力，而且认为联邦法律优先于州法律。所以被推翻就是因为它超越了联邦移民法的权威。此题也可在第三段第二句话，因为它提到on the overturned provision, 意思是大部分人认为议会故意占据了领地，Arizona因此侵犯了联邦的享有特权的权力。所以，答案是B
37.【答案】C
【解析】此题考查考生对文章细节信息的把握能力
　根据题干的关键词the Justice 和Paragraph 4, 就可以准确定位在第四段。因为是判断正误题，我们就可以采用排除的方法。通过观察选项，发现B.C都是围绕State, 我们就可以先找关于它的内容。第四段第二句话提到，议会通常想象联邦和州一起实施移民法律，而且明确鼓励州和联邦的官员共享信息以及合作。所以C选项，即州在移民实施方面的合法的作用，是正确答案。
38.【答案】D
【解析】此题考查考生对文章细节信息的推理引申能力
　　根据题干中的关键词Paragraph 5和the Alien and Sedition, 就可以精确定位在第五段第二句话的最后，也就是回归到the Alien and Sedition法案的州特权，所以和法案有关联的就是选项D. 而且我们也不难发现，B和D是一对矛盾选项，通过阅读文章，排除D.
39.【答案】A
【解析】此题考查考生对文章细节信息的把握能力
　　根据题干中的关键词the White House, 定位在第六段。最后一句提到白宫声称它能够使任何它不同意的州法律不合法，也就是选项A.
40.【答案】D
【解析】此题考查考生对文章主旨的把握能力
　　根据前三段得出文章的主旨和移民法律有关，只有A和D提到，答案在其中之一。而A是说通常被议会决定，和本段第三段句话内容冲突。所以答案是D.

41.【答案】E
【考点分析】 复现结构+代词纸带关系定位
【解析】此题为段中空，因此此空所填内容是由其上下文决定的。上句中Yet this enormous resource 没有对如今的global challenges做出足够的贡献，这些global challenges 包括 climate change, security, sustainable development and health. E选项中These issues指代上句中的各种global challenges，并且all have root causes in human behavior解释了为什么说this enormous resource in not contributing enough to today’s global challenges。因此E 选项为正确答案。
42.【答案】F
【考点分析】上下文逻辑关系定位
【解析】此题为段首空，其内容由下一句决定。空后说This is a shame，那么此句之前，即空中所填的内容一定是一个让人感觉 shameful的事情。只有F 选项中many social scientists seem reluctant to tackle such problems 是应该羞愧的事情。因此可以确定F 选项为正确答案
43. 【答案】B
【考点分析】复现结构定位
【解析】此题为段尾空，其内容由上句确定。上一句句子主要意思是包括关键词environmental changed 和 climate change 的论文的数量迅速增长.，根据段落内容一致性原则，下面应该继续讲此类论文的数量问题。只有选项B 中继续说，“然而，这些数量还是很小的”，从内容上来说衔接十分紧密，因此B 为正确答案。
44. 【答案】G
【考点分析】代词指代关系定位
【解析】此题为段中空，其内容由其上下句决定。空后面句子说this is an adequate amount，这是一个充足的数字。那么空中一定要出现的是一些数字，而选项中提到数字的只有B 和G 选项。B 选择数字之前直接说明the numbers are still small，数字仍然很小，与空后面说充足的数量矛盾，故排除。G 选项national spending …varied from around 4% to 25%, 符合空中所要求的内容，故为正确答案。
45. 【答案】C
【考点分析】复现结构定位+代词指代关系定位
【解析】此题为段中空，其内容由其上下句确定。空后面有个代词that 并且说明That should create more collaborative endeavors 那将带来一个“合作性的”endeavors. C选项中the idea is to force social to integrate 也就是整合 their work with other categories。Integrate 与collaborative 同义复现，故为正确答案。

　　Decisions after Graduation
　　Recently, there has been a growing concern among the public over the topic of the choice after graduation. As is described in the picture, a group of graduates is facing various roads such as: searching for jobs, pursuing further study, going abroad and entrepreneurship. The picture intends to convey to us this message: As adults, college students have to make decisions about their future life.
　　After graduation, college students have to make decisions about their future life. For those who are eager to become economically independent and to put into practice what they have learned in college, taking a job or doing poineering work will be both satisfying and rewarding. Getting established as a bread-winner after graduation is their main desire. By contrast, those who want to take advantage of the favorable conditions in college, however, will try to enroll in graduate programs inside or outside. For them, a Master's degree or even a Doctoral degree represents a much more ambitious goal than a bachelor's degree. In the same way, their lifetime success and interest lies more in academic achievements than in making money.
As far as I am concerned, it is sensible that we should take a rational attitude towards the decisive choice. For the part of my own, getting a higher degree abroad has long been my dream. This is based on my belief that I should do more research and learn more while I am still young.

Text 1
 Come on CEverybody’s doing it. That whispered message, half invitation and half forcing, is what most of us think of when we hear the words peer pressure. It usually leads to no good-drinking, drugs and casual sex. But in her new book Join the Club, Tina Rosenberg contends that peer pressure can also be a positive force through what she calls the social cure, in which organizations and officials use the power of group dynamics to help individuals improve their lives and possibly the word.
 Rosenberg, the recipient of a Pulitzer Prize, offers a host of example of the social cure in action: In South Carolina, a state-sponsored antismoking program called Rage Against the Haze sets out to make cigarettes uncool. In South Africa, an HIV-prevention initiative known as LoveLife recruits young people to promote safe sex among their peers.
 The idea seems promising，and Rosenberg is a perceptive observer. Her critique of the lameness of many pubic-health campaigns is spot-on: they fail to mobilize peer pressure for healthy habits, and they demonstrate a seriously flawed understanding of psychology.” Dare to be different, please don’t smoke!” pleads one billboard campaign aimed at reducing smoking among teenagers-teenagers, who desire nothing more than fitting in. Rosenberg argues convincingly that public-health advocates ought to take a page from advertisers, so skilled at applying peer pressure.
 But on the general effectiveness of the social cure, Rosenberg is less persuasive. Join the Club is filled with too much irrelevant detail and not enough exploration of the social and biological factors that make peer pressure so powerful. The most glaring flaw of the social cure as it’s presented here is that it doesn’t work very well for very long. Rage Against the Haze failed once state funding was cut. Evidence that the LoveLife program produces lasting changes is limited and mixed.
 There’s no doubt that our peer groups exert enormous influence on our behavior. An emerging body of research shows that positive health habits-as well as negative ones-spread through networks of friends via social communication. This is a subtle form of peer pressure: we unconsciously imitate the behavior we see every day.
  Far less certain, however, is how successfully experts and bureaucrats can select our peer groups and steer their activities in virtuous directions. It’s like the teacher who breaks up the troublemakers in the back row by pairing them with better-behaved classmates. The tactic never really works. And that’s the problem with a social cure engineered from the outside: in the real world, as in school, we insist on choosing our own friends.
  21. According to the first paragraph, peer pressure often emerges as
  [A] a supplement to the social cure
  [B] a stimulus to group dynamics
  [C] an obstacle to school progress
  [D] a cause of undesirable behaviors
  22. Rosenberg holds that public advocates should
  [A] recruit professional advertisers
  [B] learn from advertisers’ experience
  [C] stay away from commercial advertisers
  [D] recognize the limitations of advertisements
23. In the author’s view, Rosenberg’s book fails to
  [A] adequately probe social and biological factors
  [B] effectively evade the flaws of the social cure
  [C] illustrate the functions of state funding
  [D]produce a long-lasting social effect
  24. Paragraph 5shows that our imitation of behaviors
  [A] is harmful to our networks of friends
  [B] will mislead behavioral studies
  [C] occurs without our realizing it
  [D] can produce negative health habits
  25. The author suggests in the last paragraph that the effect of peer pressure is
  [A] harmful
  [B] desirable
  [C] profound
  [D] questionable

  A deal is a deal-except, apparently ,when Entergy is involved. The company, a major energy supplier in New England, provoked justified outrage in Vermont last week when it announced it was reneging on a longstanding commitment to abide by the strict nuclear regulations.
  Instead, the company has done precisely what it had long promised it would not challenge the constitutionality of Vermont’s rules in the federal court, as part of a desperate effort to keep its Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant running. It’s a stunning move.
  The conflict has been surfacing since 2002, when the corporation bought Vermont’s only nuclear power plant, an aging reactor in Vernon. As a condition of receiving state approval for the sale, the company agreed to seek permission from state regulators to operate past 2012. In 2006, the state went a step further, requiring that any extension of the plant’s license be subject to Vermont legislature’s approval. Then, too, the company went along.
  Either Entergy never really intended to live by those commitments, or it simply didn’t foresee what would happen next. A string of accidents, including the partial collapse of a cooling tower in 207 and the discovery of an underground pipe system leakage, raised serious questions about both Vermont Yankee’s safety and Entergy’s managementC especially after the company made misleading statements about the pipe. Enraged by Entergy’s behavior, the Vermont Senate voted 26 to 4 last year against allowing an extension.
  Now the company is suddenly claiming that the 2002 agreement is invalid because of the 2006 legislation, and that only the federal government has regulatory power over nuclear issues. The legal issues in the case are obscure: whereas the Supreme Court has ruled that states do have some regulatory authority over nuclear power, legal scholars say that Vermont case will offer a precedent-setting test of how far those powers extend. Certainly, there are valid concerns about the patchwork regulations that could result if every state sets its own rules. But had Entergy kept its word, that debate would be beside the point.
  The company seems to have concluded that its reputation in Vermont is already so damaged that it has noting left to lose by going to war with the state. But there should be consequences. Permission to run a nuclear plant is a poblic trust. Entergy runs 11 other reactors in the United States, including Pilgrim Nuclear station in Plymouth. Pledging to run Pilgrim safely, the company has applied for federal permission to keep it open for another 20 years. But as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) reviews the company’s application, it should keep it mind what promises from Entergy are worth.
  26. The phrase “reneging on”(Line 3.para.1) is closest in meaning to
  [A] condemning.
  [B] reaffirming.
  [C] dishonoring.
  [D] securing.
  27. By entering into the 2002 agreement, Entergy intended to
  [A] obtain protection from Vermont regulators.
  [B] seek favor from the federal legislature.
  [C] acquire an extension of its business license .
  [D] get permission to purchase a power plant.
  28. According to Paragraph 4, Entergy seems to have problems with its
  [A] managerial practices.
  [B] technical innovativeness.
  [C] financial goals.
  [D] business vision
29. In the author’s view, the Vermont case will test
  [A] Entergy’s capacity to fulfill all its promises.
  [B] the mature of states’ patchwork regulations.
  [C] the federal authority over nuclear issues .
  [D] the limits of states’ power over nuclear issues.
  30. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that
  [A] Entergy’s business elsewhere might be affected.
  [B] the authority of the NRC will be defied.
  [C] Entergy will withdraw its Plymouth application.
  [D] Vermont’s reputation might be damaged.
Text 3
  In the idealized version of how science is done, facts about the world are waiting to be observed and collected by objective researchers who use the scientific method to carry out their work. But in the everyday practice of science, discovery frequently follows an ambiguous and complicated route. We aim to be objective, but we cannot escape the context of our unique life experience. Prior knowledge and interest influence what we experience, what we think our experiences mean, and the subsequent actions we take. Opportunities for misinterpretation, error, and self-deception abound.
  Consequently, discovery claims should be thought of as protoscience. Similar to newly staked mining claims, they are full of potential. But it takes collective scrutiny and acceptance to transform a discovery claim into a mature discovery. This is the credibility process, through which the individual researcher’s me, here, now becomes the community’s anyone, anywhere, anytime. Objective knowledge is the goal, not the starting point.
  Once a discovery claim becomes public, the discoverer receives intellectual credit. But, unlike with mining claims, the community takes control of what happens next. Within the complex social structure of the scientific community, researchers make discoveries; editors and reviewers act as gatekeepers by controlling the publication process; other scientists use the new finding to suit their own purposes; and finally, the public (including other scientists) receives the new discovery and possibly accompanying technology. As a discovery claim works it through the community, the interaction and confrontation between shared and competing beliefs about the science and the technology involved transforms an individual’s discovery claim into the community’s credible discovery.
  Two paradoxes exist throughout this credibility process. First, scientific work tends to focus on some aspect of prevailing Knowledge that is viewed as incomplete or incorrect. Little reward accompanies duplication and confirmation of what is already known and believed. The goal is new-search, not re-search. Not surprisingly, newly published discovery claims and credible discoveries that appear to be important and convincing will always be open to challenge and potential modification or refutation by future researchers. Second, novelty itself frequently provokes disbelief. Nobel Laureate and physiologist Albert Azent-Gyorgyi once described discovery as “seeing what everybody has seen and thinking what nobody has thought.” But thinking what nobody else has thought and telling others what they have missed may not change their views. Sometimes years are required for truly novel discovery claims to be accepted and appreciated.
  In the end, credibility “happens” to a discovery claim C a process that corresponds to what philosopher Annette Baier has described as the commons of the mind. “We reason together, challenge, revise, and complete each other’s reasoning and each other’s conceptions of reason.”
  31. According to the first paragraph, the process of discovery is characterized by its
  [A] uncertainty and complexity.
  [B] misconception and deceptiveness.
  [C] logicality and objectivity.
  [D] systematicness and regularity.
  32. It can be inferred from Paragraph 2 that credibility process requires
  [A] strict inspection.
  [B]shared efforts.
  [C] individual wisdom.
  [D]persistent innovation.
  33.Paragraph 3 shows that a discovery claim becomes credible after it
  [A] has attracted the attention of the general public.
  [B]has been examined by the scientific community.
  [C] has received recognition from editors and reviewers.
  [D]has been frequently quoted by peer scientists.
  34. Albert Szent-Gy?rgyi would most likely agree that
  [A] scientific claims will survive challenges.
  [B]discoveries today inspire future research.
  [C] efforts to make discoveries are justified.
  [D]scientific work calls for a critical mind.
  35.Which of the following would be the best title of the test?
  [A] Novelty as an Engine of Scientific Development.
  [B]Collective Scrutiny in Scientific Discovery.
  [C] Evolution of Credibility in Doing Science.
  [D]Challenge to Credibility at the Gate to Science.
Text 4
  If the trade unionist Jimmy Hoffa were alive today, he would probably represent civil servant. When Hoffa’s Teamsters were in their prime in 1960, only one in ten American government workers belonged to a union; now 36% do. In 2009 the number of unionists in America’s public sector passed that of their fellow members in the private sector. In Britain, more than half of public-sector workers but only about 15% of private-sector ones are unionized.
  There are three reasons for the public-sector unions’ thriving. First, they can shut things down without suffering much in the way of consequences. Second, they are mostly bright and well-educated. A quarter of America’s public-sector workers have a university degree. Third, they now dominate left-of-centre politics. Some of their ties go back a long way. Britain’s Labor Party, as its name implies, has long been associated with trade unionism. Its current leader, Ed Miliband, owes his position to votes from public-sector unions.
  At the state level their influence can be even more fearsome. Mark Baldassare of the Public Policy Institute of California points out that much of the state’s budget is patrolled by unions. The teachers’ unions keep an eye on schools, the CCPOA on prisons and a variety of labor groups on health care.
  In many rich countries average wages in the state sector are higher than in the private one. But the real gains come in benefits and work practices. Politicians have repeatedly “backloaded” public-sector pay deals, keeping the pay increases modest but adding to holidays and especially pensions that are already generous.
  Reform has been vigorously opposed, perhaps most egregiously in education, where charter schools, academies and merit pay all faced drawn-out battles. Even though there is plenty of evidence that the quality of the teachers is the most important variable, teachers’ unions have fought against getting rid of bad ones and promoting good ones.
  As the cost to everyone else has become clearer, politicians have begun to clamp down. In Wisconsin the unions have rallied thousands of supporters against Scott Walker, the hardline Republican governor. But many within the public sector suffer under the current system, too.
  John Donahue at Harvard’s Kennedy School points out that the norms of culture in Western civil services suit those who want to stay put but is bad for high achievers. The only American public-sector workers who earn well above $250,000 a year are university sports coaches and the president of the United States. Bankers’ fat pay packets have attracted much criticism, but a public-sector system that does not reward high achievers may be a much bigger problem for America.
  36. It can be learned from the first paragraph that
  [A] Teamsters still have a large body of members.
  [B] Jimmy Hoffa used to work as a civil servant.
  [C] unions have enlarged their public-sector membership.
  [D]the government has improved its relationship with unionists.
  37. Which of the following is true of Paragraph 2?
  [A] Public-sector unions are prudent in taking actions.
  [B] Education is required for public-sector union membership.
  [C] Labor Party has long been fighting against public-sector unions.
  [D]Public-sector unions seldom get in trouble for their actions.
  38. It can be learned from Paragraph 4 that the income in the state sector is
  [A] illegally secured.
  [B] indirectly augmented.
  [C] excessively increased.
  [D]fairly adjusted.
  39. The example of the unions in Wisconsin shows that unions
  [A]often run against the current political system.
  [B]can change people’s political attitudes.
  [C]may be a barrier to public-sector reforms.
  [D]are dominant in the government.
  40. John Donahue’s attitude towards the public-sector system is one of
  [A]disapproval.
  [B]appreciation.
  [C]tolerance.
  [D]indifference.

  But for all the reasons there are to celebrate the computer, we must also tread with caution. (42)I call it a secret war for two reasons. First, most people do not realise that there are strong commercial agendas at work to keep them in passive consumption mode. Second, the majority of people who use networked computers to upload are not even aware of the significance of what they are doing.
  All animals download, but only a few upload. Beavers build dams and birds make nests. Yet for the most part, the animal kingdom moves through the world downloading. Humans are unique in their capacity to not only make tools but then turn around and use them to create superfluous material goods - paintings, sculpture and architecture - and superfluous experiences - music, literature, religion and philosophy. (43)
  For all the possibilities of our new culture machines, most people are still stuck in download mode. Even after the advent of widespread social media, a pyramid of production remains, with a small number of people uploading material, a slightly larger group commenting on or modifying that content, and a huge percentage remaining content to just consume. (44)
  Television is a one-way tap flowing into our homes. The hardest task that television asks of anyone is to turn the power off after he has turned it on.
  (45)
  What counts as meaningful uploading? My definition revolves around the concept of "stickiness" - creations and experiences to which others adhere.
  [A] Of course, it is precisely these superfluous things that define human culture and ultimately what it is to be human. Downloading and consuming culture requires great skills, but failing to move beyond downloading is to strip oneself of a defining constituent of humanity.
  [B] Applications like tumblr.com, which allow users to combine pictures, words and other media in creative ways and then share them, have the potential to add stickiness by amusing, entertaining and enlightening others.
  [C] Not only did they develop such a device but by the turn of the millennium they had also managed to embed it in a worldwide system accessed by billions of people every day.
  [D] This is because the networked computer has sparked a secret war between downloading and uploading - between passive consumption and active creation - whose outcome will shape our collective future in ways we can only begin to imagine.
  [E] The challenge the computer mounts to television thus bears little similarity to one format being replaced by another in the manner of record players being replaced by CD players.
  [F] One reason for the persistence of this pyramid of production is that for the past half-century, much of the world's media culture has been defined by a single medium - television - and television is defined by downloading.
  [G]The networked computer offers the first chance in 50 years to reverse the flow, to encourage thoughtful downloading and, even more importantly, meaningful uploading.

  Since the days of Aristotle, a search for universal principles has characterized the scientific enterprise. In some ways, this quest for commonalities defines science. Newton’s laws of motion and Darwinian evolution each bind a host of different phenomena into a single explicatory frame work.
  (46)In physics, one approach takes this impulse for unification to its extreme, and seeks a theory of everything―a single generative equation for all we see.It is becoming less clear, however, that such a theory would be a simplification, given the dimensions and universes that it might entail, nonetheless, unification of sorts remains a major goal.
  This tendency in the natural sciences has long been evident in the social sciences too. (47)Here, Darwinism seems to offer justification for it all humans share common origins it seems reasonable to suppose that cultural diversity could also be traced to more constrained beginnings. Just as the bewildering variety of human courtship rituals might all be considered forms of sexual selection, perhaps the world’s languages, music, social and religious customs and even history are governed by universal features. (48)To filter out what is unique from what is shared might enable us to understand how complex cultural behavior arose and what guides it in evolutionary or cognitive terms.
  That, at least, is the hope. But a comparative study of linguistic traits published online today supplies a reality check. Russell Gray at the University of Auckland and his colleagues consider the evolution of grammars in the light of two previous attempts to find universality in language.
  The most famous of these efforts was initiated by Noam Chomsky, who suggested that humans are born with an innate language―acquisition capacity that dictates a universal grammar. A few generative rules are then sufficient to unfold the entire fundamental structure of a language, which is why children can learn it so quickly.
(49)The second, by Joshua Greenberg, takes a more empirical approach to universality identifying traits (particularly in word order) shared by many language which are considered to represent biases that result from cognitive constraints
  Gray and his colleagues have put them to the test by examining four family trees that between them represent more than 2,000 languages.(50)Chomsky’s grammar should show patterns of language change that are independent of the family tree or the pathway tracked through it. Whereas Greenbergian universality predicts strong co-dependencies between particular types of word-order relations. Neither of these patterns is borne out by the analysis, suggesting that the structures of the languages are lire age-specific and not governed by universals

2012考研英语真题答案解析
Section Ⅰ Use of English

  1．【答案】[B]
　　【解析】此空有赖于对后文的理解。这直接体现了我们作完型的整体思路，也就是首先通读全文。尤其是看到最后一段直接给出提议：希望法官和政治划清界限从而保证自己的权威性，因此全文的导向和逻辑就非常清晰了。同时，题2答案(when)也顺势而出：如果法官们和政治家一样，法庭就不能捍卫自己作为法律卫道士的权威。
  2.【答案】[A]
　　【解析】这里的when其实表示条件关系，即“如果……。”
  3.【答案】[B]
　　【解析】选择 weakened。上下文语义题+词义辨析。选项含义差别较大，要求对上下文逻辑关系掌握清楚。Yet表示一个转折：“即使这样，还是有很多法官这样做，损害了法庭独立和公正的名声。” 本题如果能把导向把握准，即可定位在B和D两项，D项eliminated 过于绝对，排除。
  4.【答案】[D]
　　【解析】上下文语义。依然是通过上下文逻辑关系，按段精度解题。这段用两个法官参与政治事件的例子说明他们的行为使得法院的裁决不偏不倚而被认可变得不太可能。A选项challenged 和C项suspected意义相反，和主旨矛盾，即肯定了法官参与政治行为。B项compromised “调停” 和主题无关。
  5.【答案】[C]
　　【解析】上下文语义题。本段属于总分形式。首先提出法官参与政治导致的问题，然后分析问题的原因：“这种情况有一部分是由于法官们不受伦理道德准则的约束。” 其他三项不合逻辑，均不具干扰性。
 6.【答案】[B]
　　【解析】完型填空在历史上对于subject这个词一向情有独钟。04年，05年，08年以及10年选项中都出现，只有05年落选。而且这3年考查的意思都一致，即“易遭受……”，考查形式有“is subjected to”， “is subject to” 以及 “subject sb. to sth。(使得某人容易遭受)”。今年依然是“subject”入选，但是这次取了大家最熟悉的意思，即“使服从，受…管制”，“法院应该依行为准则办事”。至于选项A resistant 和 C immune两个选项和subject 这三个词在04年的第8道题也同时出现。“Be immune to”指“对…免疫，不起作用”。可见很多时候命题人不总以内容为基础来设置干扰选项，也提醒大家要重视对于历年真题的复习。
7.【答案】[D]
　　【解析】上下文语义题。选项所在的句子是定语从句，修饰前面的“code of conduct”， 即“法院应该让自己服从于那些也同样应用于其他联邦法院的行为准则”。A项resort to：诉诸于，求助于; B项sticks to: 坚持;这两项的主语都不能是“code”，属搭配不当。C项lead to，导致。意义不符，直接排除。
  8.【答案】[B]
　　【解析】上下文语义+固定搭配。“raise the question of” 提出了……的问题。这一句是承上启下段。全文的导向是“法官法庭应该和政治分离开来”，然后引出负面例子，紧接着就引出了这句话：“这些案件提出了问题：究竟法庭和政治之间是否还存在界限。” 言下之意，法官和法庭和政治总是撇不清关系，符合全文导向。A. evade “规避，逃避” 和D项“处理，解决”，不符合上下文逻辑。 C项“否决”和后面的 “question whether…” 构不成搭配。
  9.【答案】[A]
　　【解析】上下文语义+固定搭配。“a line between…”：“在…存在或划清界限”。
  10.【答案】[B]
　【解析】介词用法。envision…as… 把……预想成为…
  11.【答案】[A]
　　【解析】逻辑关系词。前后句明显是因果关系，so 引导一个结果状语从句。
12.【答案】[C]
　　【解析】上下文语义题。“法官被赋予永恒地位，因而可以不用顾忌惩戒那些有权力的人。”其他三个选项均不符合上下文逻辑。
  13.【答案】[C]
　　【解析】上下文语义题。“有了这种地位做保障，也就不需要再去花心思培养发展政治支持。”
 14【答案】[D]
【解析】上下文语义题。“法制系统旨在将政治与法律相分隔，因为它们彼此联系太紧。”其他三项完全构不成干扰。
  15.【答案】[A]
　　【解析】词义辨析题。“liberty”和“property”同属社会基本理念，而不是 theories (理论) 或divisions (分支)。D项conception 常指具体的或个人的理念而非笼统意义的理念。
  16.【答案】[C]
　　【解析】考查熟词僻义。“Shape a plan”， 作出计划。本词所在的句子为省略了that 的定语从句。“当法院处理社会政策决议的问题时，它们制定出来的法律将不可避免的政治化。”
  17.【答案】[A]
　　【解析】考查熟词僻义。Dismiss 在这里意为“拒绝考虑，遭拒”。“这就解释了为什么不同意识形态导致的决议分歧总是被认为不公正因而不予考虑。
  18.【答案】[C]
　　【解析】依然考查熟词僻义。最后一段提出建议。希望法官们必须处理人们对于法庭合法性的质疑。“address” 一词作为“处理，解决”的意思在完型中不是第一次出现。06年的完型中最后一段“address the needs of the homeless”， 解决无家可归者的需求。只不过当年这里并没有设空。其他三项均不符合逻辑。
  19【答案】[D]
　　【解析】考查点：同义复现+熟词僻义。此题和第二段的题6构成同义复现。“be accountable to…”不是“可解释的”，而是指“有义务，对…负责”。“be agreeable to” 是“愉快的;同意的”;虽然也有“适合的，符合品位的”的意思，但题中to后面接的是code，不合逻辑。 “agreeable to everybody: 适合于所有人”。A项 “be accessible to…,可接近…，能得到的” 和B项“amiable” 和蔼可亲的，与主题无关。
  20.【答案】[D]
　　【解析】考查逻辑关系词。A项 by all means 和B 项at all costs 用法一致，切含义相近，首先排除。C项in a word 是“总之”，总结全文下结论时用，而且多用在句首。这里and连接词前面的内容是“让法律法规和政治分离开来”，后面的内容是“更能服人”，显然两者是因果关系。

Section Ⅱ Reading Comprehension

  21.【答案】[D] a cause of undesirable behaviors一些不良行为的原因
　　【解析】细节题：选项：a cause of undesirable behaviors对应文中It usually leads to no good-drinking, drugs and casual sex。题干中的often对应原文中的usually;选项中undesirable behaviors对应no good-drinking, drugs and casual sex. lead与cause。同义替换，难度不大。
  22.【答案】[B] learn from advertisers’ experience从广告人那里学习经验
　　【解析】细节题，首先根据题干中的关键词public advocates 和should 定位到：三段最后一句：Rosenberg argues convincingly that public-health advocates ought to take a page from advertisers, so skilled at applying peer pressure。分别对应句中的public-health advocates和ought to， 从四个选项中课看出来正确选项可能和advertiser或者advertisement有关，从而把目光锁定在take a page from advertisers，但是很多同学都不知道它是什么意思，但是这可从后文的，so skilled at applying，(也能熟练的运用)，再对照四个选项不难选出正确答案B，学习才能运用啊。
  23.【答案】[A] adequately probe social and biological factors 足够的探究社会和生物因素
　　【解析】考查作者的观点;从题干中可看出，题目问的是Rosenberg’s book不能(怎么样)也就是问他的不足，通过book对应第四段第二句的斜体为书名，对应题干中的book, 指出不足;后面一句中的主语Join the Club 为此人所写，所以后面的表述就是他的观点：not enough exploration of the social and biological factors that make peer pressure so powerful.： exploration对probe，同义替换，not enough exploration也和fails to adequately对应。这个题难度也不大，能明确定位，找到对应的句子，答案中的probe 可能是引起考试不敢选择A答案的关键，在09年第三篇的的第四题中，当时很多同学选择错误答案B答案是因为B选项中除了prior这个单词不认识外，其他的刚好的文中定位处的同义替换，而很多同学都达成这样一个共识：和文章中某句话相似度很高的选项不会是正确选项，选项A与第四段第二句话相似度很高。基于这两方面的原因，不认识probe这个词的考生就不敢选择A答案了。
  24.【答案】[C] occurs without our realizing it 在没有意识到的时候就出现了
　　【解析】细节题;通过题干中imitation和behaviors可定位于第五段最后一句。This is a subtle form of peer pressure: we unconsciously imitate the behavior we see every day。对 unconsciously，subtle这个词在我们04年第二篇文章的第二题的答案中出现过，04年第二篇文章关于社会中按字母排序现象的这篇文章时应该有印象，我们的27题的答案选择的是D答案：Some form of discrimination is to subtle to recognize,大家可以看一下这道题和以前考过的题出现的相似性。
  25.【答案】[D] questionable 值得怀疑的
　　【解析】态度题 考查作者对同龄人压力效果的态度，对应Far less certain, however, is…，第一句中in virtuous(正直的，有效的)directions。 但是大家不认识也不会影响句子的理解，因为紧接着第二句在举例， 就像那些老师为了将后排捣乱的学生分开而将他们和他们与表现好的学生安排在一块， The tactic never really works…(这些策略(方法)不是真正起作用的)表明作者认为同龄人压力效果是不确定的。

  2012年考研英语阅读Text2的文章来源于Boston.com上的一篇评论性文章，题为Vermont Yankee plant’s owner must honor its own promises. 文章的题材属于信息科技类文章。讲述的是有关New England 一家公司购买了核电站后，不遵守核能源的一些相关规定后所引起的一些争议。就文章本身而言，放置在Reading的第二篇，难度不能算大。因为行文中，专业性术语和词汇不多，基本不影响考生对文章总体的理解。但是本篇文章中出现了一些相对比较生僻的词汇，如：renege on, aging reaction 等，但是通过上下文的揣摩和推测，要判断出这些生词的意思应该比较容易。所以整体而言，Text2的难度系数中等。题材合理。依旧是开篇直接引出问题所在。所以第一段应该是大家应该多加留心和关注的焦点。也有助于大家理解全文，把握文章的中心大意。
  26.【答案】C
　　【解析】  语义题。考的是一个词汇在文章中的特定含义。Reneging on 出现在文章中的第一段。我们 先从选项入手。A. condemning 谴责 B. reaffirming 重申，再肯定 C. dishonoring 拒付，丢脸，不光彩 D. securing 保卫，保护 从文中我们可以看到，公司的这种行为激起了公愤，是在当它…一个长期以来坚持遵守的承诺，有关遵守严格的核能源惯例。根据常识可以判断：此处一定是一个贬义词，所以才导致引起了群众的愤怒，并且需要和commitment构成动宾关系，所以综合考虑，可以先排除A和D选项。而B选项“重申”，是一个中性词，所以本句话的意思是：这个公司违反了惯例。正确选项为：C
  27.【答案】A
　　【解析】事实细节题。“加入2002年的协议，Entergy本打算，，”需要把信息定位到文章第3段，第四行，“…the company agreed to seek permission from state regulators to operate past 2012.”公司同意2012年以后的运营需要在征得州相关管理规定的允许为前提条件。可以判断出：正确选项为A。即：打算得到来自Vermont 的管理规定的保护。应该是与原文属于同义替换。B选项错在 “Federal”一词上，扩大了范围。C选项的意思是：延长商业执照的有效期，误解了原文意思。D选项提到获得购买一个电厂的许可与原文中“已经购买了唯一的一个核电站”的描述不符，所以排除。
  28.【答案】A
　　【解析】推断性实施细节题。文章第四段在讲：公司出现的另外一些如管道泄露等等问题也给公司造成了一定的影响。所以可以判断出，不仅仅是它违背核能源惯例这一项使得它进入了当下的困境中。而是公司本身内部也存在一系列的问题。纵观选项：A。管理实践 B。技术创新
  C. 财务目标 D. 商业前景 那么属于公司的问题，并且是内部的，最终选项为A 管理实践方面出现的问题。和财务，前景以及技术方面都没有直接的关联。
  29.【答案】B
　　【解析】 事实细节题。作者认为Vermont 案例能检验出，，， 我们可以把信息定位到文章第5段第4-5行：”…legal scholars say that Vermont case will offer a precedent-setting test of how far these powers extend…” 我们可以得到是一种对权力的检测，检测各个州所拥有的这种权利到底能延伸多远。所以对象应该是针对州，而不是公司。首先排除A 和C. 余下的B选项和D选项当中，B的意思是各州这些比较杂乱的制度的成熟程度，而D选项指的是在核问题上，各州权力的局限性。结合文章，我们最终选择B选项，因为文章更多的是在指各州如何来运用自己的权利，而非强调局限性。
  30.【答案】B
　　【解析】推断题。提到一个关键词：NRC 需要定位到文章最后一个段落。文章最后一句提到：But as the NRC reviews the company’s application, it should keep it mind what from Entergy are worth。” 用排除法，可以先排除选项D 名誉可能会损坏与原文不符，因为原文说道 is already damaged. 接下来，从文章中可以看到公司提出的申请是有关年限延长的申请而非能不能在Plymouth 的申请，所以可以排除选项C. 而A选项中提到公司在其他地方的生意会受到影响恰恰与文章描述相反。所以，综上所述，正确 选项为B 也就是说这一系列的事件已经对NRC 的权威构成了一种挑战。

 本文摘自The Scientist(《科学家》)2011年2月1日刊出的题为“The Evolution of Credibility”的文章。文章围绕“信度的演变”这一话题展开论述。科学是如何打造而成?在理想化的版本中，关于世界的事实有待客观的科研人员展开收集工作。但在实际的科研工作中，科学探索通常是不确定的复杂过程。每个人所固有的生活经验，知识和兴趣偏向影响科研的过程和结果。因此通常所说的研究成果，我们只能称之为前科学，即，处于假说或不完善阶段，有待验证的理论。如何才能让其完善成熟成为科学呢?首先需要接受来自相关领域知识界的验证。如，研究成果要发表，需过编辑和评论家那关;然后其他科研者可能会引用你的文章，可能会将其应用到科技上，也可能会出现新的研究成果。这个互动、共享、竞争的过程将单个的研究成果演变为公众的信度检测。
 第四段描述信度演变过程存在的两个悖论。首先，科研工作者致力于研究不完善或错误的领域，他们极少对已经验证过的东西有兴趣。因此，新的研究成果会成为他们的聚焦目标，接受来自未来科研工作的不断挑战或否定。再者，新的研究成果本身就会引起质疑，你的研究成果即使是对的，也不一定能说服他人。有时候，一项正确的新的研究成果需要经过几年，几十年才能为大家所接受。最后，这项研究成果终于具备了信度。
  31.【答案】A
　　【解析】答案在文章第一段第四行，ambiguous and complicated 与 选项A. uncertainty and complexity同义词转换，为正确选项。
  32.【答案】B
　　【解析】第二段第三句 it takes collective scrutiny and acceptance to …选项B表达了相同意思，为同义句。再者，第二段为承上启下段，后面的第三段对这个观点进行了详细论述。
  33.【答案】B
　　【解析】此为段落概括的考察，A是无关选项，文中没有提到;选项C，D为干扰项，只是文中所说的一个方面，以小概念偷换大概念，此为考研英语干扰项常见模式。
  34.【答案】D
　　【解析】此题较难，很容易选错。首先，选项A，B可以排除，因为A，B是第一个悖论的观点，Albert的话属于第二个悖论。英语文章具有很强的逻辑性，且非常清晰，标点符号是最好的识别标志。另外，根据句子意思，选项C与段落关联不大，因此D为最佳答案。
  35.【答案】C
　　【解析】此题为全文主旨题，较为容易。

  这是出自经济学人杂志2011年3月11号的一篇文章，题为：
  Enemies of progress ：The biggest barrier to public- sector reform are the unions
  36.【答案】C
　　【解析】解析：段落推理题 优先对应主题和转折;但是都没有，只能逐个排除：
  [A] Teamsters still have a large body of members. Teamsters依然有大量的会员
  文中没有提及
  [B] Jimmy Hoffa used to work as a civil servant. Jimmy Hoffa曾经是一名公务员
  he would probably represent civil servant他可能会代表公务员，并不意味着他是公务员。
  [C] unions have enlarged their public-sector membership。工会已经增加了其公共行业的会员
  only one in ten American government workers belonged to a union; now 36% do。
  现在有36%确实增加了。正解!
  [D]the government has improved its relationship with unionists。
  政府已经提升了其同工会会员之间的关系。
  没有提及政府和工会会员之间的关系排除。
  37.【答案】A
　　【解析】细节题中的which 题，只能一个个排除：
  先看[B] Education is required for public-sector union membership。
  公共行业的工会会员需要教育
  文中说到了Second, they are mostly bright and well-educated. A quarter of America’s public-sector workers have a university degree。但是并没有说需要教育。
  再看[C] Labor Party has long been fighting against public-sector unions。
  工党同公共行业的工会长期斗争
  Britain’s Labor Party, as its name implies, has long been associated with trade unionism。
  选项和原文间的表述是相反的。
  再看[D]Public-sector unions seldom get in trouble for their actions。
  公共行业的工会很少由于他们的行为而惹麻烦。
  First, they can shut things down without suffering much in the way of consequences。
  首先他们可以罢工而不遭受后果。
  同义替换成功。
  最后看[A] Public-sector unions are prudent in taking actions。
  公共行业的工会在采取行动是会更加谨慎
  这是一个很强烈的干扰项，但是文中并没有提到工会很谨慎，原文----选项A----选项B
  最后答案只能选A而不能选B;B 为未提及选项。
  38.【答案】B
　　【解析】细节题 对应keeping the pay increases modest but adding to holidays and especially pensions that are already generous。保持收入小幅上涨，但是增加假期特别是已经很慷慨的补助了。
  主要是一个单词大家不认识augmented出题人开始耍无赖了，考研词汇大纲中并无此单词，不过根据另外一个副词是可以推出答案的。
  39.【答案】C
　　【解析】例证题 找观点 Reform has been vigorously opposed;之后的例子就应该围绕改革来讲。
  40.【答案】A
　　【解析】局部态度题，在转折的地方but a public-sector system that does not reward high achievers may be a much bigger problem for America出现bigger problem 表明了态度为disapproval。.

Part B
  41.【答案】C
　　【解析】复现结构定位法+代词指代定位法
  41题出现在段尾。复现结构“The second half of the 20th century”20世纪后半期，与“the turn of the millennium”千年之交。代词 “such a device”指代“fabulous machine、typewriter and printing press”等设备。因此，正确答案为C。
  42.【答案】D
　　【解析】复现结构定位法
42题出现在段中，根据就近原则，线索为“ a secret war”一场秘密的战争。正确答案为D。
  43.【答案】A
　　【解析】逻辑关系定位法+复现结构定位法+代词指代定位法
  43题出现在文章段尾，前一句中提到superfluous material goods多余的材料，选项A中宾语these superfluous things这些多余的东西，可以在43题前一句中找到所指。前后两句话形成一个因果的逻辑关系，用连接词Of course ，因此正确答案为A。
  44.【答案】F
　　【解析】代词指代定位法+复现结构定位法
  44题出现在段尾，起到承上启下的作用。第一个复现点在44题前一句主语a pyramid of production 在选项F中宾语this pyramid of production复现。第二个复现点在television 是下一段落的主语，所以F选项为正确答案。
  45.【答案】G
　　【解析】复现结构定位法
  45题出现在段尾，起承上启下的作用。前文提到电视是one-way tap flowing单向流动，而互联网可以reverse the flow 逆转这个流动。the flow的所指one-way tap flowing单向流动。第二个复现结构在于启下，45题下一段为特殊疑问句，中心词为meaningful uploading有意义的上传，选项G提及meaningful uploading这一信息，所以，选项G为正确答案。

Part C
  本文选自2011年4月14日出版的《自然》杂志，为一篇人文社科类文章，涉及语言学方面。从词汇角度，涉及到一些考生难以把握的较具专业性的词语;从语法角度，题目主从句之间的关系也不是很复杂。主要考查了定语从句，宾语从句，形式主语，非谓语动词等。
  46. 【解析】本题语法结构并不复杂，关键在于对于概念陌生的unification的正确把握。unification是动词unify的名词形式，意为“统一、一元化”。然而，结合上段最后一句：Newton's laws of motion and Darwinian evolution each bind a host of different phenomena into a single explicatory framework。以及本句并列结构后半部分，可以把握在本文中，意为：一致的解释理论。另外，本句最后还到对定语从句的考查：we see为all的定语从句。
  【参考译文】在物理学上，有一种方法把这种追求一致解释理论的愿望发挥到了极致，它试图找到一种万物的理论――用唯一的生成等式解释我们能看到的所有事物。
  47.【解析】本句语法结构并不复杂，for为连词，意为“因为”。后半句涉及到对于形式主语的考查。
  【参考译文】在此，达尔文主义似乎提供了一种合理解释，因为如果整个人类都有着相同的起源，那么认为，文化多样性也可能追溯到人类更有局限性的开端，似乎是有理由的。
  48.【解析】本句主语为不定式短语to filter out what is unique from what is shared，谓语部分为enable sb to do sth。其中考查了4个宾语从句，语法结构方面较上两句复杂。句中代词it指代complex cultural behavior;term一词，考生可联想短语in terms of(就…而言，在…方面)来选择恰当词义;filter out意为：“过滤掉、筛除、淘汰”。
  【参考译文】如果我们从共性之中去除个性，那么或许我们能够理解复杂的文化行为如何产生，以及何种因素在进化或认识的角度，引导了这种复杂的文化行为。
  49.【解析】本题考点涉及代词的还原，现在分词做状语，过去分词做后置定语，非限制性定语从句以及被动。句首the second，回上文寻找，可在上段第一句找到The most famous of these efforts was initiated by Noam Chomsky，其中initiate为“发起、创始”，可推知此处为the second effort，即上文的two previous attempts;shared by many language修饰traits;which引导的定语从句，同样修饰traits;定语从句的中的被动语态可采用主动的译法，添加主语“人们”。
  【参考译文】做出第二次努力的是乔舒亚?格林伯雷。他采用更加经验的方法来研究这种普遍性，他发现了多种语言的共同特征(特别是词序上的特征)，而人们认为这种共同特征体现了认识由于认知局限所产生的偏见。
  50.【解析】语法结构方面，本句考查了定语从句，过去分词做后置定语，并列结构等。词汇方面，family tree词义的选择，可借助上文by examining four family trees that between them represent more than 2,000 languages，可判断为语言的谱系，后文代词it指代family tree。
  【参考译文】乔姆斯基的语法应该表明语言变化的模式，这种模式独立于语言谱系，或者独立于由该谱系所产生的路径，而格林伯格的普遍性理论则认为在特定种类的词序关系之间，有着紧密的相互依赖关系。

  【详解】： 认真分析图画，两个人针对同一个掉在地上的酒瓶，作出完全了不同的反应。一个人看到的是那些洒在地上的酒，因此唉声叹气。另一个人看到的时候剩在酒瓶里的酒，因此觉得情况尚没有那么糟糕。从图中信息不难看出，出题者意图是反映面对困境时两类不同的人的不同态度。前者悲观因此眼中尽是悲剧，而后者乐观却总能看喜剧。因此可知，本文写作中心应该围绕不同的态度导致不同人生。写作过程中由于本文中心比较抽象，因此可以佐以例证。

  In recent years, there have been great concerns over the life attitude of the youngsters. As is depicted in the picture above, facing a bottle with most the wine spilled out on the ground, one man is sighing the tragedy, whereas the other rejoices over the remained wine in the bottle。
  The real implications of the picture lies in that different attitude leads to completely diverse results. For optimistic people, they could find the happiness even facing the most difficult situation. And life is a comedy. Conversely, for people with pessimistic attitude, troubles are everywhere and always exist. Their lives is filled with one after another tragedies。
  To my best understanding, the story of Den Yaping could be the best illustration of this point. If she kept upset by her stature, she could not have achieved so much in table tennis. All in all, young people should bear in mind that "better to light a candle than to curse the darkness"。

Text 1
The decision of the New York Philharmonic to hire Alan Gilbert as its next music director has been the talk of the classical-music world ever since the sudden announcement of his appointment in 2009. For the most part, the response has been favorable, to say the least. “Hooray! At last!” wrote Anthony Tommasini, a sober-sided classical-music critic.
One of the reasons why the appointment came as such a surprise, however, is that Gilbert is comparatively little known. Even Tommasini, who had advocated Gilbert’s appointment in the Times, calls him “an unpretentious musician with no air of the formidable conductor about him.” As a description of the next music director of an orchestra that has hitherto been led by musicians like Gustav Mahler and Pierre Boulez, that seems likely to have struck at least some Times readers as faint praise.
For my part, I have no idea whether Gilbert is a great conductor or even a good one. To be sure, he performs an impressive variety of interesting compositions, but it is not necessary for me to visit Avery Fisher Hall, or anywhere else, to hear interesting orchestral music. All I have to do is to go to my CD shelf, or boot up my computer and download still more recorded music from iTunes.
Devoted concertgoers who reply that recordings are no substitute for live performance are missing the point. For the time, attention, and money of the art-loving public, classical instrumentalists must compete not only with opera houses, dance troupes, theater companies, and museums, but also with the recorded performances of the great classical musicians of the 20th century. There recordings are cheap, available everywhere, and very often much higher in artistic quality than today’s live performances; moreover, they can be “consumed” at a time and place of the listener’s choosing. The widespread availability of such recordings has thus brought about a crisis in the institution of the traditional classical concert.
One possible response is for classical performers to program attractive new music that is not yet available on record. Gilbert’s own interest in new music has been widely noted: Alex Ross, a classical-music critic, has described him as a man who is capable of turning the Philharmonic into “a markedly different, more vibrant organization.” But what will be the nature of that difference? Merely expanding the orchestra’s repertoire will not be enough. If Gilbert and the Philharmonic are to succeed, they must first change the relationship between America’s oldest orchestra and the new audience it hops to attract.
21. We learn from Para.1 that Gilbert’s appointment has
[A]incurred criticism.    [B]raised suspicion.   [C]received acclaim.   [D]aroused curiosity.
22. Tommasini regards Gilbert as an artist who is 
[A]influential.   [B]modest.   [C]respectable.   [D]talented.
23. The author believes that the devoted concertgoers
[A]ignore the expenses of live performances.   [B]reject most kinds of recorded performances.
[C]exaggerate the variety of live performances. [D]overestimate the value of live performances.
24. According to the text, which of the following is true of recordings?
[A]They are often inferior to live concerts in quality.
[B]They are easily accessible to the general public.
[C]They help improve the quality of music.    [D]They have only covered masterpieces.
25. Regarding Gilbert’s role in revitalizing the Philharmonic, the author feels
[A]doubtful.  [B]enthusiastic.   [C]confident.  [D]puzzled.

When Liam McGee departed as president of Bank of America in August, his explanation was surprisingly straight up. Rather than cloaking his exit in the usual vague excuses, he came right out and said he was leaving “to pursue my goal of running a company.” Broadcasting his ambition was “very much my decision,” McGee says. Within two weeks, he was talking for the first time with the board of Hartford Financial Services Group, which named him CEO and chairman on September 29.
McGee says leaving without a position lined up gave him time to reflect on what kind of company he wanted to run. It also sent a clear message to the outside world about his aspirations. And McGee isn’t alone. In recent weeks the No.2 executives at Avon and American Express quit with the explanation that they were looking for a CEO post. As boards scrutinize succession plans in response to shareholder pressure, executives who don’t get the nod also may wish to move on. A turbulent business environment also has senior managers cautious of letting vague pronouncements cloud their reputations. 
As the first signs of recovery begin to take hold, deputy chiefs may be more willing to make the jump without a net. In the third quarter, CEO turnover was down 23% from a year ago as nervous boards stuck with the leaders they had, according to Liberum Research. As the economy picks up, opportunities will abound for aspiring leaders.
The decision to quit a senior position to look for a better one is unconventional. For years executives and headhunters have adhered to the rule that the most attractive CEO candidates are the ones who must be poached. Says Korn/Ferry senior partner Dennis Carey:”I can’t think of a single search I’ve done where a board has not instructed me to look at sitting CEOs first.”
Those who jumped without a job haven’t always landed in top positions quickly. Ellen Marram quit as chief of Tropicana a decade age, saying she wanted to be a CEO. It was a year before she became head of a tiny Internet-based commodities exchange. Robert Willumstad left Citigroup in 2005 with ambitions to be a CEO. He finally took that post at a major financial institution three years later.
Many recruiters say the old disgrace is fading for top performers. The financial crisis has made it more acceptable to be between jobs or to leave a bad one. “The traditional rule was it’s safer to stay where you are, but that’s been fundamentally inverted,” says one headhunter. “The people who’ve been hurt the worst are those who’ve stayed too long.”
26. When McGee announced his departure, his manner can best be described as being
[A]arrogant.  [B]frank.  [C]self-centered.  [D]impulsive.
27. According to Paragraph 2, senior executives’ quitting may be spurred by
[A]their expectation of better financial status.  [B]their need to reflect on their private life.
[C]their strained relations with the boards.     [D]their pursuit of new career goals.
28. The word “poached” (Line 3, Paragraph 4) most probably means
[A]approved of.  [B]attended to.  [C]hunted for.   [D]guarded against.
29. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that
[A]top performers used to cling to their posts. [B]loyalty of top performers is getting out-dated.
[C]top performers care more about reputations. [D]it’s safer to stick to the traditional rules.
30. Which of the following is the best title for the text?
[A]CEOs: Where to Go?                 [B]CEOs: All the Way Up?
[C]Top Managers Jump without a Net       [D]The Only Way Out for Top Performers

The rough guide to marketing success used to be that you got what you paid for. No longer. While traditional “paid” media C such as television commercials and print advertisements C still play a major role, companies today can exploit many alternative forms of media. Consumers passionate about a product may create “owned” media by sending e-mail alerts about products and sales to customers registered with its Web site. The way consumers now approach the broad range of factors beyond conventional paid media.
Paid and owned media are controlled by marketers promoting their own products. For earned media , such marketers act as the initiator for users’ responses. But in some cases, one marketer’s owned media become another marketer’s paid media C for instance, when an e-commerce retailer sells ad space on its Web site. We define such sold media as owned media whose traffic is so strong that other organizations place their content or e-commerce engines within that environment. This trend ,which we believe is still in its infancy, effectively began with retailers and travel providers such as airlines and hotels and will no doubt go further. Johnson & Johnson, for example, has created BabyCenter, a stand-alone media property that promotes complementary and even competitive products. Besides generating income, the presence of other marketers makes the site seem objective, gives companies opportunities to learn valuable information about the appeal of other companies’ marketing, and may help expand user traffic for all companies concerned.
The same dramatic technological changes that have provided marketers with more (and more diverse) communications choices have also increased the risk that passionate consumers will voice their opinions in quicker, more visible, and much more damaging ways. Such hijacked media are the opposite of earned media: an asset or campaign becomes hostage to consumers, other stakeholders, or activists who make negative allegations about a brand or product. Members of social networks, for instance, are learning that they can hijack media to apply pressure on the businesses that originally created them.
If that happens, passionate consumers would try to persuade others to boycott products, putting the reputation of the target company at risk. In such a case, the company’s response may not be sufficiently quick or thoughtful, and the learning curve has been steep. Toyota Motor, for example, alleviated some of the damage from its recall crisis earlier this year with a relatively quick and well-orchestrated social-media response campaign, which included efforts to engage with consumers directly on sites such as Twitter and the social-news site Digg.
31.Consumers may create “earned” media when they are 
[A] obscssed with online shopping at certain Web sites. 
[B] inspired by product-promoting e-mails sent to them. 
[C] eager to help their friends promote quality products.
[D] enthusiastic about recommending their favorite products. 
32. According to Paragraph 2,sold media feature 
[A] a safe business environment.        [B] random competition. 
[C] strong user traffic.                 [D] flexibility in organization. 
33. The author indicates in Paragraph 3 that earned media
[A] invite constant conflicts with passionate consumers. 
[B] can be used to produce negative effects in marketing. 
[C] may be responsible for fiercer competition.
[D] deserve all the negative comments about them.
34. Toyota Motor’s experience is cited as an example of 
[A] responding effectively to hijacked media.[B] persuading customers into boycotting products.
[C] cooperating with supportive consumers. [D] taking advantage of hijacked media.
35. Which of the following is the text mainly about ?
[A] Alternatives to conventional paid media.[B] Conflict between hijacked and earned media.
[C] Dominance of hijacked media.        [D] Popularity of owned media.

Text 4
It’s no surprise that Jennifer Senior’s insightful, provocative magazine cover story, “I love My Children, I Hate My Life,” is arousing much chatter C nothing gets people talking like the suggestion that child rearing is anything less than a completely fulfilling, life-enriching experience. Rather than concluding that children make parents either happy or miserable, Senior suggests we need to redefine happiness: instead of thinking of it as something that can be measured by moment-to-moment joy, we should consider being happy as a past-tense condition. Even though the day-to-day experience of raising kids can be soul-crushingly hard, Senior writes that “the very things that in the moment dampen our moods can later be sources of intense gratification and delight.”
The magazine cover showing an attractive mother holding a cute baby is hardly the only Madonna-and-child image on newsstands this week. There are also stories about newly adoptive C and newly single C mom Sandra Bullock, as well as the usual “Jennifer Aniston is pregnant” news. Practically every week features at least one celebrity mom, or mom-to-be, smiling on the newsstands.
In a society that so persistently celebrates procreation, is it any wonder that admitting you regret having children is equivalent to admitting you support kitten-killing ? It doesn’t seem quite fair, then, to compare the regrets of parents to the regrets of the children. Unhappy parents rarely are provoked to wonder if they shouldn’t have had kids, but unhappy childless folks are bothered with the message that children are the single most important thing in the world: obviously their misery must be a direct result of the gaping baby-size holes in their lives.
Of course, the image of parenthood that celebrity magazines like Us Weekly and People present is hugely unrealistic, especially when the parents are single mothers like Bullock. According to several studies concluding that parents are less happy than childless couples, single parents are the least happy of all. No shock there, considering how much work it is to raise a kid without a partner to lean on; yet to hear Sandra and Britney tell it, raising a kid on their “own” (read: with round-the-clock help) is a piece of cake.
It’s hard to imagine that many people are dumb enough to want children just because Reese and Angelina make it look so glamorous: most adults understand that a baby is not a haircut. But it’s interesting to wonder if the images we see every week of stress-free, happiness-enhancing parenthood aren’t in some small, subconscious way contributing to our own dissatisfactions with the actual experience, in the same way that a small part of us hoped getting “ the Rachel” might make us look just a little bit like Jennifer Aniston.
36.Jennifer Senior suggests in her article that raising a child can bring
[A]temporary delight                [B]enjoyment in progress
[C]happiness in retrospect            [D]lasting reward
37.We learn from Paragraph 2 that
[A]celebrity moms are a permanent source for gossip.
[B]single mothers with babies deserve greater attention.
[C]news about pregnant celebrities is entertaining.
[D]having children is highly valued by the public.
38.It is suggested in Paragraph 3 that childless folks
[A]are constantly exposed to criticism.         [B]are largely ignored by the media.
[C]fail to fulfill their social responsibilities.     [D]are less likely to be satisfied with their life.
39.According to Paragraph 4, the message conveyed by celebrity magazines is
[A]soothing   .[B]ambiguous.  [C]compensatory.  [D]misleading.
40.Which of the following can be inferred from the last paragraph?
[A]Having children contributes little to the glamour of celebrity moms.
[B]Celebrity moms have influenced our attitude towards child rearing.
[C]Having children intensifies our dissatisfaction with life.
[D]We sometimes neglect the happiness from child rearing.

[A] No disciplines have seized on professionalism with as much enthusiasm as the humanities. You can, Mr Menand points out, became a lawyer in three years and a medical doctor in four. But the regular time it takes to get a doctoral degree in the humanities is nine years. Not surprisingly, up to half of all doctoral students in English drop out before getting their degrees.
[B] His concern is mainly with the humanities: Literature, languages, philosophy and so on. These are disciplines that are going out of style: 22% of American college graduates now major in business compared with only 2% in history and 4% in English. However, many leading American universities want their undergraduates to have a grounding in the basic canon of ideas that every educated person should posses. But most find it difficult to agree on what a “general education” should look like. At Harvard, Mr Menand notes, “the great books are read because they have been read”-they form a sort of social glue.
[C] Equally unsurprisingly, only about half end up with professorships for which they entered graduate school. There are simply too few posts. This is partly because universities continue to produce ever more PhDs. But fewer students want to study humanities subjects: English departments awarded more bachelor’s degrees in 1970-71 than they did 20 years later. Fewer students requires fewer teachers. So, at the end of a decade of theses-writing, many humanities students leave the profession to do something for which they have not been trained.
[D] One reason why it is hard to design and teach such courses is that they can cut across the insistence by top American universities that liberal-arts educations and professional education should be kept separate, taught in different schools. Many students experience both varieties. Although more than half of Harvard undergraduates end up in law, medicine or business, future doctors and lawyers must study a non-specialist liberal-arts degree before embarking on a professional qualification.
[E] Besides professionalizing the professions by this separation, top American universities have professionalised the professor. The growth in public money for academic research has speeded the process: federal research grants rose fourfold between 1960and 1990, but faculty teaching hours fell by half as research took its toll. Professionalism has turned the acquisition of a doctoral degree into a prerequisite for a successful academic career: as late as 1969a third of American professors did not possess one. But the key idea behind professionalisation, argues Mr Menand, is that “the knowledge and skills needed for a particular specialization are transmissible but not transferable.”So disciplines acquire a monopoly not just over the production of knowledge, but also over the production of the producers of knowledge.
[F] The key to reforming higher education, concludes Mr Menand, is to alter the way in which “the producers of knowledge are produced.”Otherwise, academics will continue to think dangerously alike, increasingly detached from the societies which they study, investigate and criticize.”Academic inquiry, at least in some fields, may need to become less exclusionary and more holistic.”Yet quite how that happens, Mr Menand dose not say.
[G] The subtle and intelligent little book The Marketplace of Ideas: Reform and Resistance in the American University should be read by every student thinking of applying to take a doctoral degree. They may then decide to go elsewhere. For something curious has been happening in American Universities, and Louis Menand, a professor of English at Harvard University, captured it skillfully.

With its theme that “Mind is the master weaver,” creating our inner character and outer circumstances, the book As a Man Thinking by James Allen is an in-depth exploration of the central idea of self-help writing.
(46) Allen’s contribution was to take an assumption we all share-that because we are not robots we therefore control our thoughts-and reveal its erroneous nature. Because most of us believe that mind is separate from matter, we think that thoughts can be hidden and made powerless; this allows us to think one way and act another. However, Allen believed that the unconscious mind generates as much action as the conscious mind, and (47) while we may be able to sustain the illusion of control through the conscious mind alone, in reality we are continually faced with a question: “Why cannot I make myself do this or achieve that? ”
Since desire and will are damaged by the presence of thoughts that do not accord with desire, Allen concluded : “ We do not attract what we want, but what we are.” Achievement happens because you as a person embody the external achievement; you don’t “ get” success but become it. There is no gap between mind and matter.
Part of the fame of Allen’s book is its contention that “Circumstances do not make a person, they reveal him.” (48) This seems a justification for neglect of those in need, and a rationalization of exploitation, of the superiority of those at the top and the inferiority of those at the bottom.
This ,however, would be a knee-jerk reaction to a subtle argument. Each set of circumstances, however bad, offers a unique opportunity for growth. If circumstances always determined the life and prospects of people, then humanity would never have progressed. In fat, (49)circumstances seem to be designed to bring out the best in us and if we feel that we have been “wronged” then we are unlikely to begin a conscious effort to escape from our situation .Nevertheless, as any biographer knows, a person’s early life and its conditions are often the greatest gift to an individual.
The sobering aspect of Allen’s book is that we have no one else to blame for our present condition except ourselves. (50) The upside is the possibilities contained in knowing that everything is up to us; where before we were experts in the array of limitations, now we become authorities of what is possible.

19.【答案】[A] 
　【解析】词义辨析题。根据前文信息，由前面的实验结果“那些被强制锻炼笑肌的人比那些嘴唇皱着表情失望的人在观看有趣的动画片时反应更加丰富”，我们可以推断出一个结论A. suggesting表明，后接结论的句子，符合要求，故为正确答案。B. requiring “需要，要求”，    C. mentioning “提到”，D. supposing“假定， 假设”都不符合上下文语境，故排除。
20.【答案】[C] 
　【解析】逻辑分析题。上文提到了“表情而不是其他的方式可能会影响情绪”，后文又提到了“笑的生理行为可以使心情好转”，前后句解释的是同一种情况。A. Eventually和B. Consequently，都是作为“总结”的副词，D. Conversely表示“相反”，只有 C. Similarly“相似的是”，符合上下文逻辑，是正确选项。

21.【答案】[C] 
　 【解析】推断题。本题要求根据文章第一段，判断社会对Gilbert的任命有什么回应和反响。根据原文第一段第二句“For the most part, the response has been favorable, …”和“Hooray! At last!”可知回应是积极的，因此正确答案是[C] received acclaim(得到称赞)。
　　干扰项：选项[A] incurred criticism (招致批评)，选项[B] raised suspicion(引起怀疑)， 选项[D] aroused curiosity(引起大众的好奇)，都不符合原文意思。
22.【答案】[B] 
　 【解析】细节题。根据Tommasini在第二段对Gilbert的评论：calls him “ an unpretentious musician with no air of the formidable conductor about him”，可知Tommasini认为Gilbert是an unpretentious musician。unpretentious由un(否定前缀)和pretentious构成，考生看到pretentious可以想到pretend (假装，作假 )，那么可推出unpretentious是“不做假的，不虚饰或矫揉造作的”，答案[B] modest(谦逊的)意思最为接近，故[B]项为正确答案。
　　干扰项：文中提到，with no air of the formidable conductor about him，意思是“他没有指挥家那种强大的、令人敬畏的气势”，据此我们可以排除选项[A] influential(有影响力的)和选项[C] respectable (值得尊敬的)。选项[D] talented (有才华的)在文中也找不到依据，故排除。
23.【答案】[D] 
　 【解析】推断题。本题考查作者对于现场表演的虔诚追随者的观点态度。从文章第三段可知，作者自己选择听唱片/录音而不是听现场音乐会。第四段开头作者提到，devoted concertgoers认为“录音不能代替现场表演”，但作者认为devoted concertgoers are missing the point(现场表演虔诚的追随者没有切中要害)，之后是论据支持作者的观点，作者认为These recordings are cheap, available everywhere, and very often much higher in artistic quality than today’s live performances，即录音便宜、容易得到，且通常比今天的现场音乐会有更高的艺术品质。[D]项overestimate the value of live performances(高估了现场表演的价值)是对作者对于devoted concertgoers观点的高度概括，故为正确答案。
　　干扰项：选项[A]意思是“喜欢听现场音乐会的人忽视了现场表演的花销”，原文确实提到These recordings are cheap，但是这个选项片面，没有概括性。选项[B]意思是“拒绝大多数种类演唱会录音”没有概括出作者对于devoted concertgoers的观点态度，太浅显，且与原文对devoted concertgoers的描述Devoted concertgoers who reply that recordings are no substitute for live performance …存在误差。选项[C]意思是“夸大了现场表演的多样性”，原文没有提到。
24.【答案】[D] 
　 【解析】推断题。关于recordings，作者主要在第四段加以论述。从第四段第三句“These recordings are cheap，available everywhere…”和第四段最后一句“the widespread availability of such recordings has thus brought …。”很容易推断出选项[B] They are easily accessible to the general public(大众很容易就能得到这些唱片)为正确答案。
　　干扰项：选项[A]意思是“唱片在质量方面经常是次于现场音乐会”，由第四段第三句“These recordings are cheap…very often much higher in artistic quality than today’s live performances” 可知选项[A]是错误的。选项[C]“他们帮助提高了音乐的品质”是对文中“These recordings …very often much higher in artistic quality than today’s live performances”的曲解。选项[D]太过绝对，无法从文中推出。
25.【答案】[A] 
　 【解析】态度题。本题考查作者对于Gilbert在振兴交响乐团中的作用是什么态度。文章最后一段，尤其是最后三句提到，“But what will be the nature of that difference? Merely expanding the orchestra’s repertoire will not be enough. If Gilbert and the Philharmonic are to succeed, they must first change the relationship between America’s oldest orchestra and the new audience it hopes to attract。”很明显作者认为“Gilbert与众不同的实质仅仅是增加了管弦乐队的节目，这是不够的”，“Gilbert和the Philharmonic要想成功，还必须做一些事情”，由此可知作者不满意Gilbert在振兴交响乐团中的作用。故[A]项doubtful(怀疑的)为正确答案。
　　干扰项：[B]项enthusiastic(充满热情的)和[C]项confident(有信心)为反面干扰项。[D]项puzzled(迷惑的)是不符合常识的，作者不可能对其论述的内容迷惑不解，故排除。

Text 2
26.【答案】[B] 
【解析】细节题。题目问到“当McGee宣布他离开时，对他的态度可以最好的描述为    。”文章首段首句提到，“When Liam McGee departed …, his explanation was surprisingly straight up。”，即“当Liam McGee离开时，他的解释是直率的”，后文具体描述时还提到，“Rather than cloaking his exit in the usual vague excuses, he came right out and said …”，即“他不是用通常模糊的理由掩饰他的离开，而是坦率地说……”，所以正确答案为[B]项frank(坦率的)，是对文中“straight up”和“right out”的同义替换。
　　干扰项：[A]项arrogant(傲慢的)是从文中broadcasting his ambition过度推理而来的，不能选；[C]项self-centered(自我为中心的)是从“was very much my decision”主观臆断来的，不能选；[D]项impulsive(冲动的)是近义干扰，但是在原文中找不到依据。

27.【答案】[D] 
　 【解析】细节题。本题问驱使高级管理人员离职的可能原因。文章第二段首先谈到，McGee思考他想要经营什么样的公司，他的离职给外界传递了他的aspirations(渴望)。第三句And McGee isn’t alone。谈到不光McGee是这种情况，言外之意是“很多高级管理人员是同样的情况”，下面举例谈到“… the No. 2 executives at Avon and American Express … quit with the explanation that they were looking for a CEO post”，即高管辞职是因为他们有新的渴望，追求新的职业目标。故[D]项their pursuit of new career goals(他们追求新的职业目标)为正确答案。
干扰项：[A]项中的financial status在本段范围内未提及；[B]项中的reflect on their private life是对文中reflect on what kind of company he wanted to run的严重曲解；[C]项是根据第二段倒数第二句编造的选项，选项内容与原文不符且不能回答本题提问，故为干扰项。
28.【答案】[C] 
　 【解析】词义题。第四段首句是该段中心句，谈到辞去高级职位寻找更好职位的决定不是常规的。后文围绕该中心句论述。要推断的词poached出现在该段第二句中：For years executives and headhunters have adhered to the rule that the most attractive CEO candidates are the ones who must be poached。意思是“多年来高官们和猎头坚持这一原则：最新吸引人的CEO候选人一定会……”，从含义上我们可以推断出be poached的含义为“被寻找、被注意到、被重视”的意思。故从[B]项和[C]项中选答案。考虑到[C]项中的hunted for含义正确，且是文中出现的headhunters和search的同义替换，证据确凿，故为正确答案。
　　干扰项：[A]项approved of(被赞成)、[B]项attended of(被照顾、被看护)含义不准确。[D]项guarded against(被预防)与原文意思相反。
29.【答案】[A] 
　 【解析】推断题。该段第二句提到，The financial crisis has made it more acceptable to be between jobs or to leave a bad one，意思是金融危机使得跳槽或离开糟糕的岗位更可被接受。后面引用一个猎头的话进一步证明这一观点，猎头说：传统的规则认为呆在原地更安全，但是这已经从根本上改变了。那些最受伤的人们是那些呆最长时间的人。[A]项top performers used to cling to their posts(高管过去常常坚持他们的岗位)是对文中“The traditional rule was it’s safer to say where you are, but that’s been fundamentally inverted”的同义替换。
　　干扰项：[B]项中提到的loyalty一词是原文没有的概念，“不呆在原岗位”与“忠诚过时”不是同一个概念。[C]项是根据该段首句改编的选项，但与首句含义相反。[D]项与本段的核心信息相反。
30.【答案】[C] 
　 【解析】本文以Liam McGee的故事开头，他宣布离职的方式非常坦率，两周后找到了新职位。第二段继续谈到，McGee在没有找到新职位的情况下离开，这给了他思考未来的时间，同他一样，高管们离职的原因是要去追求新的职业目标。第三段中心是，高管们更愿意在没有新职位的情况下跳槽。第四段的中心是辞去高级职位然后去寻找更好的工作不是常规做法。第五段谈到没有工作就跳槽的那些人并不总是很快就有高职位。第六段讲如今跳槽或离开不好的工作更为可取。文章一直在重复一个主题“高管们辞职后再去找新工作”，故[C]项Top Managers Jump without a Net(高管们在没有新工作的情况下辞职)为正确答案。文中的“McGee leaving without a position lined up，deputy chiefs may be more willing to make the jump without a net，to quit a position to look for a better one，jump without a job”都在重复这个主题。
　　干扰项：[A]项CEOs: Where to Go(CEO们：路在何方？)，文中并没有谈及CEO们的出路问题，故不能概括文章主旨；[B]项CEOs: All the Way Up?( CEO们：一路向上？)，很宽泛，没能准确反映中心；[D]项中的only太过绝对，不能成为文章主旨。

31.【答案】[D] 
　 【解析】细节题。题目“当消费者______时，可能会造就‘免费’媒体”。定位到第一段第三句前半句话“Consumers passionate about a product may create “earned” media by willingly promoting it to friends”，意思是“消费者由于很喜欢某个产品，故主动地将之向朋友推荐，由此造就了‘免费’媒体”，选项[D] enthusiastic about recommending their favorite products(热衷于向朋友推荐他们最喜欢的产品)。
　　干扰项：[A] obsessed with online shopping at certain web sites (沉迷于在某个网站进行网购)，而文中未提到网络购买。[B] inspired by product-promotion e-mails sent to them (受到产品促销邮件的鼓励)，文中消费者向朋友推荐喜欢的商品是他们的主动行为，而非被动。[C] eager to help their friends promote quality products (热心帮助朋友推荐高质量的产品)，文中是向朋友推荐，而非帮朋友推荐，故排除。
32.【答案】[C] 
　 【解析】细节推断题。题目“由第二段可知，收费媒体的特点是_____”。定位到第二段第四句“We define such sold media as owned media whose traffic is so strong that other organizations place their content or e-ecommerce engines within that envrionment”，由此句可知收费媒体(sold media)是指那些流量非常大的免费媒体，由于他们的流量如此之大以至于其他的机构也乐于把自己的产品信息或者电子上午引擎置于这些免费媒体中，于是就会向免费媒体购买广告位置(结合本段第三句理解)，由此可知选项[C] strong user traffic(强大的用户流量)为正确答案。
　　干扰项：[A] a safe business environment (安全的商业环境)[B] random competition (自由竞争)[D] flexibility in organization (组织灵活)均非文中信息，无中生有。
33.【答案】[B] 
　 【解析】细节题。题目“第三段中，作者认为免费媒体______”。第三段提到免费媒体提供便利的同时，也带来了风险，比如可能被利用去传播某个品牌或产品的负面信息，由此可知选项[B] can be used to produce negative effects in marketing (可能会被用来制造对营销不利的负面影响)正符合此意。
　　干扰项：[A] invite constant conflicts with passionate consumers (导致不断与热情的消费者产生冲突)，为反向干扰。[C] may be responsible for fiercer competition (可能会造成更激烈的竞争)，非第三段讲解的内容。[D] deserve all the negative comments about them (应该受到所有这些负面的批评)，原文提到会有负面批评，但未提及是他们应得的，为主观臆断。
34.【答案】[A] 
　 【解析】例证题。题目“Toyota Motor是一个_______的例子”。定位到末段，末段主要提到热情的消费者可能会号召其他人抵制某个产品，威胁到产品所属公司的名声，这时公司的回应有可能不够迅速、周到。这是本段的核心信息。接下来就拿Toyota Motor举例，举例中提到这个公司在公司名声遇到如上提到的危机情况时作出的反应，且成功减轻了危害程度。由此可知，例子是对本段中心句的一个反面例子论证公司对hijacked media的反应。故选项[A](有效地回应被劫持利用的媒体)为正确答案。
　　干扰项：[B] persuading customers into boycotting products (劝说消费者抵制产品)，文中末段第一句提到了消费者可能会劝说其他人抵制某些产品，故为张冠李戴。[C] cooperating with supportive consumers (与支持自己的消费者合作)，在例子中提到Toyota Motor公司缓解危机的方式是与消费者直接沟通，这首先属于例子内的信息，不符合例证题的解题思路，其次沟通交流不等于合作，故排除。[D] taking advantage of hijacked media (利用被劫持的媒体)，文中是消除被劫持媒体带来的危害，而非去利用被劫持的媒体，故排除。
35.【答案】[A] 
　 【解析】主旨题。题目“这篇文化在那个主要讲述的是______”。本文首段第三句就提出文章中心“companies today can exploit many alternative forms of media”，即虽然传统收费媒体仍在发挥重大作用，但是现今的公司可以去选择其他媒体形式。后文主要是介绍其他可选择的媒体形式，并对其作出评论。故选项[A] Alternatives to conventional paid media (与传统收费媒体对应的其他媒体形式)为正确答案。
　　干扰项：[B] Conflict between hijacked and earned media (被劫持媒体和免费媒体之间的冲突)[C] Dominance of hijacked media (被劫持媒体的支配地位)[D] Popularity of owned media (免费媒体的普遍性)均为文中的部分信息，不足以概括全文，故都排除。

Text 4
36.【答案】[C] 
　 【解析】细节题。题目“Jenifer Senior在她的文章中认为养育孩子可以带来_____”。定位到第一段第二句“Senior suggests that we need to redefine happiness: instead of thinking of it as something that can be measured by moment-to-moment joy, we should consider being happy as a past-tense condition”，意思是说我们应该把幸福看作为一种“过去时”的状态，而不应该把它看作为一种可以即时即地的快乐。最后一句补充道，那些一开始让我们情绪低落的事情，后来可能会是强烈的满足和快乐感的来源。由此可知，选项[C] happiness in retrospect(幸福的回忆、回顾往事时的幸福感)为正确答案。
　　干扰项：[A] temporary delight(暂时的快乐)，为反向干扰。[B] enjoyment in progress(慢慢增加的快乐)，不符合原文过去(沮丧)与后来(幸福快乐)的对比。[D] lasting reward(持久的回报)为无中生有。
37.【答案】[D] 
　 【解析】推断题。题目“由第二段可知_____”。定位到第二段。第二段是承接第一段中心“养育孩子能成为后来幸福快乐的源泉”而来的，符合中心表达的意思。而且在第三段首句接着第二段提到“in a society that so persistently celebrates procreation(在一个如此赞扬生育的社会中)”，这是一个承上启下的句子，是对第二段的总结，也符合第一段以及第二段对养育孩子的正面评价。故选项[D] having children is highly valued by the public (养育孩子受到大众的高度重视)，是对原文赞扬生育的同义替换，为正确答案。
　　干扰项：[A] celebrity moms are a permanent source for gossip (名人妈妈是八卦的不竭来源)、[B] single mothers with babies deserve greater attention (带孩子的单身母亲应该得到更多的关注)、[C] news about pregnant celebrities is entertaining (名人怀孕的新闻更具有娱乐性)，均偏离文章中心。
38.【答案】[A] 
　 【解析】细节推断题。题目“由第三段可知，无儿女的人们会_____”。第三段最后一句but后面的信息提到，不幸福但育有儿女的父母很少会遭到挑衅，而去思考他们当初是不是不应该要孩子，但是不幸福且无儿女的人们经常会受到一个信息的困扰，即孩子是世界上唯一最重要的事情。后面又补充道，很明显正是没有孩子这一人生中的空白导直接导致了他们的痛苦。故选项[A] are constantly exposed to criticism (常常是指责的对象)符合此意，为正确答案。
　　干扰项：[B] are largely ignored by the media (在很大程度上为媒体所忽视)，媒体关注的对象的确不是那些不养育孩子的人们，但这不是第三段的内容，故排除。[C] fail to fulfill their social responsibilities (未能履行他们的社会责任)，文中未提到社会责任这一说，而且本文中心也非讨论不养育孩子人们的社会责任问题，故排除。[D] are less likely to be satisfied with their life (更有可能对自己的生活不满)，文中比较的是不幸福的有儿女的父母和不幸福的无儿女的人们，但没有明确说哪类人更满意自己的生活，故排除。
39.【答案】[D] 
　  【解析】细节题。题目中“名人杂志传达的信息是_____”。定位到原文第四段第一句“the image of parenthood that celebrity magazines like Us Weekly and People present is hugely unrealistic”，名人杂志中为人父母的形象是非常不现实的。选项[D] misleading(误导的)是对原文unrealistic的同义替换。
干扰选项：[A] soothing (抚慰的，令人宽心的)、[B] ambiguous (模糊的)、[C] compensatory (补偿的)均为无中生有。
40.【答案】[B] 
　 【解析】推断题。题目“从最后一段我们可以推断出如下哪个选项”。定位到最后一段转折处“But it’s interesting to wonder if the images we see every week of stress-free, happiness-enhancing parenthood aren’t in some small, subconscious way contributing to our own satisfactions with the actual experience, in the say way that a small part of us hoped getting ‘the Rachel’ might make us just a little bit like Jennifer Anniston”，意思为我们每周看到的名人形象(没有压力、提升幸福感的名人形象)会使我们潜意识中对现实经历有所不满。由此可知，选项[B] Celebrity moms have influenced out attitude towards child rearing (名人妈妈形象影响了我们对抚养孩子的态度)是正确的。
　　干扰选项：[A] Having children contributes little to the glamour of celebrity moms(生育孩子对名人妈妈的魅力影响不大)，与末段第一句相反，为反向干扰。[C] Having children intensifies our dissatisfaction with life(生育孩子加剧了我们对生活的不满)，为反向干扰，原因：最后一段第一句提到养孩子在杂志上是魅力无穷的，但在现实中大多数成年人都懂得养孩子不像理发那么简单，接下来一句转而说杂志上的名人形象到底还是影响到了人们对养育孩子的态度。[D] We sometimes neglect the happiness from child rearing (我们有时会忽略养育孩子带来的幸福感)，在原文中没提到忽略这种幸福感，属于无中生有。

Part B
41．【答案】[B] 
　 【解析】从给出的开头段落G，可以看出这是一篇介绍Louis Menand的书The Marketplace of Ideas: Reform and Resistance in the American University和他的观点的文章，紧接着下面就应该讲他书中阐释的问题和他的观点，B选项中开头一句提到his concern，暗示提出问题，指出美国大学存在的主要问题。从结构上来看，B选项内容能够合理地与G选项衔接，故41题正确答案为B选项。
42.【答案】[D] 
　 【解析】文章的主题是关于“humanities”。上一段提出大学人文学科正走向没落，所以下面就紧接着应该解释出现这种现象的原因，42项答案即D或者E，但因为E在后一项给出，且有连接词Besides可知，42为D。此外，D选项中首句出现的separate一词，与E选项中this separation正好构成关联，故42题应选D选项。
43.【答案】[A] 
　 【解析】A选项指出，没有哪门专业化学科像人文学科这样，需要倾注如此多的热情，之后提到获得人文学科的博士学位，需要9年的时间，这一信息可对应E选项中的the acquisition of a doctoral，从结构和内容构成了合理的衔接，所以43题应选择A。

44.【答案】[C] 
　 【解析】依据43题的选项A，说人文学科获得博士学位的时间长，需要倾注很大的热情，所以高达一半的英语博士生在获得学位之前辍学就毫不奇怪了。从剩下的选项中，首先排除F，因为F的“conclude”可知F项应为全文的总结。从C的“Equally unsurprisingly，only about half end up with the jobs they entered graduate school to get: tenured professorships。”可知，C是紧接着A，所以44题选C。
45.【答案】[F] 
　 【解析】由F选项内容可知，该段进行总结说明，往往也出现在文章末尾，应将F选项放在文章末段，故F选项为45题的答案。

46.Allen’s contribution was to take an assumption we all share---that because we are not robots we therefore control our thoughts---and reveal its erroneous nature。
　　【考查分析】本题考点：同位语从句， 定语从句
　　【答案解析】本句的主干是Allen’s contribution was to take an assumption and reveal its erroneous nature。破折号后面的that引导同位语从句，对前面的assumption解释说明。We all share是定语从句，修饰assumption。
　　【参考译文】我们每个人都认为：自己不是机器人，因此能够控制自己的思想；爱伦的贡献在于他研究了这一假说，并揭示其错误的本质。
47.While we may be able to sustain the illusion of control through the conscious mind alone, in reality we are continually faced with a question: “Why cannot I make myself do this or achieve that?”
　　【考查分析】本题考点：状语从句
　　【答案解析】本句结构特别清晰，主干是While we may be able to sustain …. ,we are faced with a question…。while引导让步状语从句，后面“Why cannot I make myself do this or achieve that?”是question 的具体内容。本句采用顺译法。
　　【参考译文】我们或许只通过意识就能维持这种控制的幻觉，但事实上，我们却总是面临一个问题：我们为什么不能让自己去做这件事情，实现那个目标呢？
　　48.This seems a justification for neglect of those in need, and a rationalization of exploitation, of the superiority of those at the top and the inferiority of those at the bottom。
　　【考查分析】本题考点： 省略、介词短语、复杂表语
　　【答案解析】本句的主体结构为：This seems a justification and a rationalization。 本句的难点在于运用很多介词短语作后置定语，介词短语套介词短语，使得宾语非常复杂。“for neglect of those in need”修饰“justification”、“of exploration”、“of the superiority”“of the inferiority” 修饰rationalization。而“of those at the top”和“of those at the bottom”又分别修饰superiority和inferiority。
　　【参考译文】这种说法似乎为忽视需要帮助的人找到了借口，使剥削合理化，令上层人优越，底层人卑微。
　　49.circumstances seem to be designed to bring out the best in us, and if we feel that we have been “wronged” then we are unlikely to begin a conscious effort to escape from our situation。
　　【考查分析】本题考点：并列从句，定语从句。
　　【答案解析】本句主体结构是：circumstances seem to be designed to…., and if we feel that… then we are unlikely to… “环境好像是为…,而设计，如果我们感受到…,我们就不可能…”； “bring out” 是产生、使…显示出来；“wronged” 是“被冤枉，被委屈”的意思，“be (un)likely to do” (不) 可能做某事；
　　【参考译文】环境似乎旨在激发我们的最大潜能，如果我们总感觉“上天不公”，那么不太可能会自觉地努力脱离现状。
　　50.The upside is the possibilities contained in knowing that everything is up to us; where before we were experts in the array of limitations, now we become authorities of what is possible. 
　　【考查分析】本题考点：主系表结构、分词短语的用法、连词where引导的状语从句。
　　【答案解析】本句主体结构为The upside is the possibilities，译为“正面意义在于可能性”。Contained in knowing that everything is up to us，是过去分词结构作后置定语。分号后面是一个有连词where引导的状语从句。Where 在这里是“在某种情况下(in what situation, to what point)的意思。
　　【参考译文】积极的一面是，既然万事都取决于我们，那么就有无限可能。以前，我们能够熟练应对种种局限；现在，我们把握着未来的可能。

　　The terrible scene depicted in the cartoon shows that some people in our life still lack the awareness of environmental protection. The picture illustrates that two tourists are chatting and eating happily on a boat and casually throwing their rubbish into the lake which is full of litter and waste. The drawing sets us thinking too much due to its far-reaching influence。
　　Nowadays, though the awareness of protecting environment is being accepted by more and more people, we can still see many unpleasant scenes especially in scenic spots. Why does this phenomenon arise? Many factors are accounting for it. First and foremost, to some people, the consciousness of protecting environment is still not so strong. They may not think it is a big deal to throw rubbish everywhere. In addition, the environmental management system isn’t so satisfying. For example, in some places there’re few regulations or the implementation is seldom performed actually。
　　From what has been discussed above, it is urgent to take some effective and relative measures. In the first place, we should continue to conduct more propaganda in communities and schools so as to let people realize the importance of protecting environment. In the second, more rules should be made and carried out by the government to restrain the conduction of destroying environment. People should work together to create clean and beautiful surroundings。

In 1924 America's National Research Council sent two engineers to supervise a series of industrial experiments at a large telephone-parts factory called the Hawthorne Plant near Chicago. It hoped they would learn how stop-floor lighting 大1家 workers' productivity. Instead, the studies ended 大2家 giving their name to the "Hawthorne effect", the extremely influential idea that the very 大3家 to being experimented upon changed subjects' behavior.

Text 1
Of all the changes that have taken place in English-language newspapers during the past quarter-century, perhaps the most far-reaching has been the inexorable decline in the scope and seriousness of their arts coverage. 
It is difficult to the point of impossibility for the average reader under the age of forty to imagine a time when high-quality arts criticism could be found in most big-city newspapers. Yet a considerable number of the most significant collections of criticism published in the 20th century consisted in large part of newspaper reviews. To read such books today is to marvel at the fact that their learned contents were once deemed suitable for publication in general-circulation dailies.
We are even farther removed from the unfocused newspaper reviews published in England between the turn of the 20th century and the eve of World War II, at a time when newsprint was dirt-cheap and stylish arts criticism was considered an ornament to the publications in which it appeared. In those far-off days, it was taken for granted that the critics of major papers would write in detail and at length about the events they covered. Theirs was a serious business, and even those reviewers who wore their learning lightly, like George Bernard Shaw and Ernest Newman, could be trusted to know what they were about. These men believed in journalism as a calling, and were proud to be published in the daily press. “So few authors have brains enough or literary gift enough to keep their own end up in journalism,” Newman wrote, “that I am tempted to define ‘journalism’ as ‘a term of contempt applied by writers who are not read to writers who are.’”
Unfortunately, these critics are virtually forgotten. Neville Cardus, who wrote for the Manchester Guardian from 1917 until shortly before his death in 1975, is now known solely as a writer of essays on the game of cricket. During his lifetime, though, he was also one of England’s foremost classical-music critics, a stylist so widely admired that his Autobiography (1947) became a best-seller. He was knighted in 1967, the first music critic to be so honored. Yet only one of his books is now in print, and his vast body of writings on music is unknown save to specialists.
Is there any chance that Cardus’s criticism will enjoy a revival? The prospect seems remote. Journalistic tastes had changed long before his death, and postmodern readers have little use for the richly upholstered Vicwardian prose in which he specialized. Moreover, the amateur tradition in music criticism has been in headlong retreat.

21.	It is indicated in Paragraphs 1 and 2 that
[A] arts criticism has disappeared from big-city newspapers.
[B] English-language newspapers used to carry more arts reviews.
[C] high-quality newspapers retain a large body of readers.

Over the past decade, thousands of patents have been granted for what are called business methods. Amazon.com received one for its "one-click" online payment system. Merrill Lynch got legal protection for an asset allocation strategy. One inventor patented a technique for lifting a box.
Now the nation's top patent court appears completely ready to scale back on business-method patents, which have been controversial ever since they were first authorized 10 years ago. In a move that has intellectual-property lawyers abuzz the U.S. court of Appeals for the federal circuit said it would use a particular case to conduct a broad review of business-method patents. In re Bilski, as the case is known , is "a very big deal", says Dennis D. Crouch of the University of Missouri School of law. It "has the potential to eliminate an entire class of patents."
Curbs on business-method claims would be a dramatic about-face, because it was the federal circuit itself that introduced such patents with its 1998 decision in the so-called state Street Bank case, approving a patent on a way of pooling mutual-fund assets. That ruling produced an explosion in business-method patent filings, initially by emerging internet companies trying to stake out exclusive rights to specific types of online transactions. Later, more established companies raced to add such patents to their files, if only as a defensive move against rivals that might beat them to the punch. In 2005, IBM noted in a court filing that it had been issued more than 300 business-method patents despite the fact that it questioned the legal basis for granting them. Similarly, some Wall Street investment films armed themselves with patents for financial products, even as they took positions in court cases opposing the practice.
The Bilski case involves a claimed patent on a method for hedging risk in the energy market. The Federal circuit issued an unusual order stating that the case would be heard by all 12 of the court's judges, rather than a typical panel of three, and that one issue it wants to evaluate is whether it should "reconsider" its state street Bank ruling.
The Federal Circuit's action comes in the wake of a series of recent decisions by the supreme Court that has narrowed the scope of protections for patent holders. Last April, for example the justices signaled that too many patents were being upheld for "inventions" that are obvious. The judges on the Federal circuit are "reacting to the anti-patent trend at the Supreme Court", says Harold C. Wegner, a patent attorney and professor at George Washington University Law School.
26.	Business-method patents have recently aroused concern because of
[A] their limited value to business
[B] their connection with asset allocation
[C] the possible restriction on their granting
[D] the controversy over their authorization
27.	Which of the following is true of the Bilski case?
[A] Its ruling complies with the court decisions
[B] It involves a very big business transaction
[C] It has been dismissed by the Federal Circuit
[D] It may change the legal practices in the U.S.
28.	The word "about-face" (Line 1, Para 3) most probably means
[A] loss of good will
[B] increase of hostility
[C] change of attitude
[D] enhancement of dignity
29.	We learn from the last two paragraphs that business-method patents
[A] are immune to legal challenges
[B] are often unnecessarily issued
[C] lower the esteem for patent holders
[D] increase the incidence of risks
30.	Which of the following would be the subject of the text?
[A] A looming threat to business-method patents
[B] Protection for business-method patent holders
[C] A legal case regarding business-method patents
[D] A prevailing trend against business-method patents
Text 3
In his book The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell argues that social epidemics are driven in large part by the acting of a tiny minority of special individuals, often called influentials, who are unusually informed, persuasive, or well-connected. The idea is intuitively compelling, but it doesn't explain how ideas actually spread.
The supposed importance of influentials derives from a plausible sounding but largely untested theory called the "two step flow of communication": Information flows from the media to the influentials and from them to everyone else. Marketers have embraced the two-step flow because it suggests that if they can just find and influence the influentials, those selected people will do most of the work for them. The theory also seems to explain the sudden and unexpected popularity of certain looks, brands, or neighborhoods. In many such cases, a cursory search for causes finds that some small group of people was wearing, promoting, or developing whatever it is before anyone else paid attention. Anecdotal evidence of this kind fits nicely with the idea that only certain special people can drive trends
In their recent work, however, some researchers have come up with the finding that influentials have far less impact on social epidemics than is generally supposed. In fact, they don't seem to be required of all.
The researchers' argument stems from a simple observing about social influence, with the exception of a few celebrities like Oprah Winfrey―whose outsize presence is primarily a function of media, not interpersonal, influence―even the most influential members of a population simply don't interact with that many others. Yet it is precisely these non-celebrity influentials who, according to the two-step-flow theory, are supposed to drive social epidemics by influencing their friends and colleagues directly. For a social epidemic to occur, however, each person so affected, must then influence his or her own acquaintances, who must in turn influence theirs, and so on; and just how many others pay attention to each of these people has little to do with the initial influential. If people in the network just two degrees removed from the initial influential prove resistant, for example, the cascade of change won't propagate very far or affect many people.
Building on the basic truth about interpersonal influence, the researchers studied the dynamics of populations manipulating a number of variables relating of populations, manipulating a number of variables relating to people's ability to influence others and their tendency to be influenced. Our work shows that the principal requirement for what we call "global cascades" C the widespread propagation of influence through networks C is the presence not of a few influentials but, rather, of a critical mass of easily influenced people.
31.	By citing the book The Tipping Point, the author intends to
[A] analyze the consequences of social epidemics
[B] discuss influentials' function in spreading ideas
[C] exemplify people's intuitive response to social epidemics
[D] describe the essential characteristics of influentials.
32.	The author suggests that the "two-step-flow theory"
[A] serves as a solution to marketing problems
[B] has helped explain certain prevalent trends
[C] has won support from influentials
[D] requires solid evidence for its validity
33.	What the researchers have observed recently shows that
[A] the power of influence goes with social interactions
[B] interpersonal links can be enhanced through the media
[C] influentials have more channels to reach the public
[D] most celebrities enjoy wide media attention
34.	The underlined phrase "these people" in paragraph 4 refers to the ones who
[A] stay outside the network of social influence
[B] have little contact with the source of influence
[C] are influenced and then influence others
[D] are influenced by the initial influential
35.	what is the essential element in the dynamics of social influence?
[A] The eagerness to be accepted
[B] The impulse to influence others
[C] The readiness to be influenced
[D] The inclination to rely on others

Bankers have been blaming themselves for their troubles in public. Behind the scenes, they have been taking aim at someone else: the accounting standard-setters. Their rules, moan the banks, have forced them to report enormous losses, and it's just not fair. These rules say they must value some assets at the price a third party would pay, not the price managers and regulators would like them to fetch.
Unfortunately, banks' lobbying now seems to be working. The details may be unknowable, but the independence of standard-setters, essential to the proper functioning of capital markets, is being compromised. And, unless banks carry toxic assets at prices that attract buyers, reviving the banking system will be difficult.
After a bruising encounter with Congress, America's Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rushed through rule changes. These gave banks more freedom to use models to value illiquid assets and more flexibility in recognizing losses on long-term assets in their income statement. Bob Herz, the FASB's chairman, cried out against those who "question our motives." Yet bank shares rose and the changes enhance what one lobby group politely calls "the use of judgment by management."
European ministers instantly demanded that the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) do likewise. The IASB says it does not want to act without overall planning, but the pressure to fold when it completes it reconstruction of rules later this year is strong. Charlie McCreevy, a European commissioner, warned the IASB that it did "not live in a political vacuum" but "in the real word" and that Europe could yet develop different rules.
It was banks that were on the wrong planet, with accounts that vastly overvalued assets. Today they argue that market prices overstate losses, because they largely reflect the temporary illiquidity of markets, not the likely extent of bad debts. The truth will not be known for years. But bank's shares trade below their book value, suggesting that investors are skeptical. And dead markets partly reflect the paralysis of banks which will not sell assets for fear of booking losses, yet are reluctant to buy all those supposed bargains.
To get the system working again, losses must be recognized and dealt with. America's new plan to buy up toxic assets will not work unless banks mark assets to levels which buyers find attractive. Successful markets require independent and even combative standard-setters. The FASB and IASB have been exactly that, cleaning up rules on stock options and pensions, for example, against hostility from special interests. But by giving in to critics now they are inviting pressure to make more concessions.
36.	Bankers complained that they were forced to
[A] follow unfavorable asset evaluation rules
[B] collect payments from third parties
[C] cooperate with the price managers
[D] reevaluate some of their assets.
37.	According to the author , the rule changes of the FASB may result in
[A] the diminishing role of management
[B] the revival of the banking system
[C] the banks' long-term asset losses
[D] the weakening of its independence
38.	According to Paragraph 4, McCreevy objects to the IASB's attempt to
[A] keep away from political influences.
[B] evade the pressure from their peers.
[C] act on their own in rule-setting.
[D] take gradual measures in reform.
39.	The author thinks the banks were "on the wrong planet" in that they
[A] misinterpreted market price indicators
[B] exaggerated the real value of their assets
[C] neglected the likely existence of bad debts.
[D] denied booking losses in their sale of assets.
40.	The author's attitude towards standard-setters is one of
[A] satisfaction.
[B] skepticism.
[C] objectiveness
[D] sympathy

[A] The first and more important is the consumer's growing preference for eating out; the consumption of food and drink in places other than homes has risen from about 32 percent of total consumption in 1995 to 35 percent in 2000 and is expected to approach 38 percent by 2005. This development is boosting wholesale demand from the food service segment by 4 to 5 percent a year across Europe, compared with growth in retail demand of 1 to 2 percent. Meanwhile, as the recession is looming large, people are getting anxious. They tend to keep a tighter hold on their purse and consider eating at home a realistic alternative.
[B] Retail sales of food and drink in Europe's largest markets are at a standstill, leaving European grocery retailers hungry for opportunities to grow. Most leading retailers have already tried e-commerce, with limited success, and expansion abroad. But almost all have ignored the big, profitable opportunity in their own backyard: the wholesale food and drink trade, which appears to be just the kind of market retailers need.
[C] Will such variations bring about a change in the overall structure of the food and drink market? Definitely not. The functioning of the market is based on flexible trends dominated by potential buyers. In other words, it is up to the buyer, rather than the seller, to decide what to buy .At any rate, this change will ultimately be acclaimed by an ever-growing number of both domestic and international consumers, regardless of how long the current consumer pattern will take hold.
[D] All in all, this clearly seems to be a market in which big retailers could profitably apply their scale, existing infrastructure and proven skills in the management of product ranges, logistics, and marketing intelligence. Retailers that master the intricacies of wholesaling in Europe may well expect to rake in substantial profits thereby. At least, that is how it looks as a whole. Closer inspection reveals important differences among the biggest national markets, especially in their customer segments and wholesale structures, as well as the competitive dynamics of individual food and drink categories. Big retailers must understand these differences before they can identify the segments of European wholesaling in which their particular abilities might unseat smaller but entrenched competitors. New skills and unfamiliar business models are needed too.
[E] Despite variations in detail, wholesale markets in the countries that have been closely examined―France, Germany, Italy, and Spain―are made out of the same building blocks. Demand comes mainly from two sources: independent mom-and-pop grocery stores which, unlike large retail chains, are too small to buy straight from producers, and food service operators that cater to consumers when they don't eat at home. Such food service operators range from snack machines to large institutional catering ventures, but most of these businesses are known in the trade as "horeca": hotels, restaurants, and cafes. Overall, Europe's wholesale market for food and drink is growing at the same sluggish pace as the retail market, but the figures, when added together, mask two opposing trends.
[F] For example, wholesale food and drink sales come to $268 billion in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom in 2000―more than 40 percent of retail sales. Moreover, average overall margins are higher in wholesale than in retail; wholesale demand from the food service sector is growing quickly as more Europeans eat out more often; and changes in the competitive dynamics of this fragmented industry are at last making it feasible for wholesalers to consolidate.
[G] However, none of these requirements should deter large retailers (and even some large good producers and existing wholesalers) from trying their hand, for those that master the intricacies of wholesaling in Europe stand to reap considerable gains.

One basic weakness in a conservation system based wholly on economic motives is that most members of the land community have no economic value. Yet these creatures are members of the biotic community and, if its stability depends on its integrity, they are entitled to continuance.
When one of these noneconomic categories is threatened and, if we happen to love it .We invert excuses to give it economic importance. At the beginning of century songbirds were supposed to be disappearing. (46) Scientists jumped to the rescue with some distinctly shaky evidence to the effect that insects would eat us up if birds failed to control them. the evidence had to be economic in order to be valid.
It is painful to read these round about accounts today. We have no land ethic yet, (47) but we have at least drawn near the point of admitting that birds should continue as a matter of intrinsic right, regardless of the presence or absence of economic advantage to us.
A parallel situation exists in respect of predatory mammals and fish-eating birds. (48) Time was when biologists somewhat over worded the evidence that these creatures preserve the health of game by killing the physically weak, or that they prey only on "worthless" species.
Some species of tree have been read out of the party by economics-minded foresters because they grow too slowly, or have too low a sale vale to pay as timber crops. (49) In Europe, where forestry is ecologically more advanced, the non-commercial tree species are recognized as members of native forest community, to be preserved as such, within reason.
To sum up: a system of conservation based solely on economic self-interest is hopelessly lopsided. (50) It tends to ignore, and thus eventually to eliminate, many elements in the land community that lack commercial value, but that are essential to its healthy functioning. It assumes, falsely, I think, that the economic parts of the biotic clock will function without the uneconomic parts.

　  【解析】细节题。根据题干，线索定位到最后一段，从"…relating of populations, manipulating a number of variables relating to people's ability to influence others and their tendency to be…"这句话中能够得知社会影响动力因素包括人们影响别人的能力包括被别人影响的倾向性。而C选项充分的体现了这一点。

Text 4
36.【答案】[A] 
　  【解析】细节题。答案意为"遵循不利的资产评估准则"。
由题干中的 "Bankers complained" 和 "force"定位于第一段第三行 "Their rules, moan the banks, have forced them to report enormous losses, and it's just not fair. These rules say they must value some assets at the price a third party would pay, not the price managers and regulators would like them to fetch。" 该句核心词为rules，四个答案中只有A选项包含。
37.【答案】[A] 
　  【解析】推理引申题。答案意为"管理的作用的逐渐消失"。根据题干中的专有名词FASB定位于第三段。第一句提到FASB经过努力使国会通过了一些变革，这些变革赋予了银行更多的权利，也就是说对银行的管理更为松散，所以答案为"管理的作用的逐渐消失"。
38.【答案】[C] 
　  【解析】细节题。答案意为"独立自主的制定法规"。根据题干中的  "McCreevy objects to"定位到第五段。第五段提到立即根据美国的变化做出一样的反应，欧洲的各界人士对此的反对十分强烈，引用McCreevy的话是为了说明这一点：欧洲要对这个问题有自己独立的法律法规。
39.【答案】[C] 
　  【解析】句意题。答案意为"忽视了坏账存在的极大可能性"。根据题干的信息定位到第六段Today they argue that market prices overstate losses, because they largely reflect the temporary illiquidity of markets, not the likely extent of bad debts。批判银行一味的夸大"that market prices overstate losses"，而忽视了"the likely extent of bad debts"。
40.【答案】[D] 
　  【解析】情感态度题。文章讨论了银行针对"standard-setters"的敌意行为，特别是文章最后一段更是明确的表明了作者对"standard-setters"的同情。

Part B
41.【答案】[B] 
　  【解析】本题需要找出文章的首段，可用排除法做。首先A 选项中提到"the first and more important…"中的 "more" 应该在前文中提到，故排除。B选项首句就提出了欧洲食品零售所面临的问题，根据文章结构法：提出问题-分析问题-解决问题，此段符合首段要求，即提出了文章的中心问题，而且本选项中也没有明显的需要和上文衔接的关系词，而其它选项都有明显的与上文衔接的信息词，不能在首段出现，故B为正确答案。
42.【答案】[F] 
　  【解析】首段一旦确定，本段内容便可根据上文顺藤摸瓜，第一段最后一句话"but"后指出了虽然食品零售商面临着"at a standstill (几乎停止发展)"的问题，他们却忽略了一个潜在的市场即他们身边的 "wholesale food and trade(食品批发市场)"。而F 选项首句便举例说明法国、德国、意大利等国家的食品批发产业的市场规模比食品零售产业要大40%。而且在"moreover"后又进一步说明批发的利润大零售很多。因此可以判断此选项是对第一段的例证说明。其中 "for example" 是明显的信息提示词。
43.【答案】[D] 
　  【解析】上段介绍了食品批发商的优势，而D选项第一句"All in all, this clearly seems to be a market in which…" 则对上文的内容进行总结，其中all in all 是较明显的信息提示词，即上文中提到的食品批发的优势推出这是明显对于 "big retailers that master the intricacies of wholesaling"是一个"market"。因此D项为正确答案。
44.【答案】[G] 
　  【解析】上段最后一句提出的"particular abilities" 以及"new skills and unfamiliar business models are needed。" , 即零售商需要新的技能及不熟悉的商业模式。而G选项第一句提到的 "these requirements(这些要求)"正是指上文所提到的技能。
45.【答案】[A] 
　  【解析】此题可以用排除法做，所剩下的选项只有A和C，需要注意的是本题并没有明显的信息词，所以需要阅读选项的内容进而找出正确答案。此题前文的已知段落E选项中最后一句"two opposing trends"在A选项中得到了体现，即一方面由于人们选择在外就餐而扩大了食品批发的需求，而另一方面人们又开始感到"anxious(焦虑)"。而C选项第一句提到的"such variations"在上文中并没有得到体现，因此可以断定A为正确答案。



Part C
46. Scinentists jumped to the rescue with some distinctly shaky evidence to the effect that insects would eat us up if birds failed to control them。
【解析】句子的主干是"scientists jumped to the rescue with some distinctly shaky evidence"，后接that 引导的同位语从句。If引导的条件状语从句修饰that从句。to the effect that大意是，意思是； fail to 未能； jump to立即，赶快 the rescue营救，援救，解救。
【参考译文】科学家们立即拿出某些明显站不住脚的证据前来救驾，大致说的是如果鸟儿不能控制害虫的话，害虫就会把我们吃掉。
47. but we have at least drawn near the point of admitting that birds should continue survival as a matter of intrinsic right, regardless of the presence or absence of economic advantage to us。
【解析】句子主干we have drawn near the point。介词短语of admitting that.。.作定语修饰point。其中嵌套了that从句作admit的宾语从句。regardless of.。.作让步状语。a matter of ...。.的问题，大约；draw near 接近，靠近；intrinsic right天生的权利，固有的权利；economic advantage经济利益，经济优势。
【参考译文】但是我们至少已经几乎承认了这样一种观点：不管鸟类对我们是否有经济利益，生存都是它们的固有权利。
48. Time was when biologists somewhat over worded the evidence that these creatures preserve the health of game by killing the physically weak,or that they prey only on "worthless species。
【解析】主干time was when...。when引导了表语从句。Time was when可看作固定短语，译为"从前，曾经"。注意两个并列同位语从句的翻译。
【参考译文】曾几何时，生物学家总是重述以下的这条证据：这些生物通过捕食弱小的动物去维持生物链的正常运行，或它们只是去捕食"没有价值的物种"。
49. In Europe, where forestry is ecologically more advanced, the non-commercial tree species are recognized as members of native forest community, to be preserved as such, within reason。
【解析】句子的主体是"the noncommercial tree species are recognized as members of the native forest community"，包含被动语态。句子开头是一个where引导的定语从句，to be preserved是修饰noncommercial tree species的成分。Within reason合情合理的，理智的。注意被动语态的处理。
【参考译文】欧洲的林业从生态上讲较为先进，它把没有成为商业化对象的树种视为原始森林群落的成员而适当地加以保护。

参考范文：
The enlightening picture portrays that a hot pot, with numerous ingredients in it, includes such domestic and alien cultures as literature, moral values and performing arts. It seems that the hot pot tastes very delicious because of the rich nutrition of the multi-cultures。
Obviously, the picture characterizes the status quo of Chinese society in which Chinese and Western culture conflict with each other but also merge into a unique form to a certain degree. Since China has opened its door widely to the outside world, many people from different countries have been deeply fascinated by Chinese culture. They will accept and love the Chinese culture as a whole. In addition, Chinese culture should be well shared with foreign people, who have shown their enthusiasm towards China. Meanwhile, the Chinese people are also exposed to foreign cultures when more foreign people come to this oriental country. In this way people from various nations in the world will be able to acquire better understanding of each other and live peacefully in this world。
In my opinion, the culture of any nation is a kind of precious heritage, and belongs to the whole mankind. With economic globalization, the blending of different cultures has become inevitable trend of the time. No country is an isolated island, be it China or the western world. The clearer we grasp the current situation, the more it would be beneficial to the global villagers。

Text 1
Habits are a funny thing. We reach for them mindlessly, setting our brains on auto-pilot and relaxing into the unconscious comfort of familiar routine. "Not choice, but habit rules the unreflecting herd," William Wordsworth said in the 19th century. In the ever-changing 21st century, even the word "habit" carries a negative implication.
So it seems paradoxical to talk about habits in the same context as creativity and innovation. But brain researchers have discovered that when we consciously develop new habits, we create parallel paths, and even entirely new brain cells, that can jump our trains of thought onto new, innovative tracks.
Rather than dismissing ourselves as unchangeable creatures of habit, we can instead direct our own change by consciously developing new habits. In fact, the more new things we try―the more we step outside our comfort zone―the more inherently creative we become, both in the workplace and in our personal lives.
But don't bother trying to kill off old habits; once those ruts of procedure are worn into the hippocampus, they're there to stay. Instead, the new habits we deliberately ingrain into ourselves create parallel pathways that can bypass those old roads.
"The first thing needed for innovation is a fascination with wonder," says Dawna Markova, author of "The Open Mind" and an executive change consultant for Professional Thinking Partners. "But we are taught instead to 'decide,' just as our president calls himself 'the Decider.' " She adds, however, that "to decide is to kill off all possibilities but one. A good innovational thinker is always exploring the many other possibilities."
All of us work through problems in ways of which we're unaware, she says. Researchers in the late 1960s discovered that humans are born with the capacity to approach challenges in four primary ways: analytically, procedurally, relationally (or collaboratively) and innovatively. At the end of adolescence, however, the brain shuts down half of that capacity, preserving only those modes of thought that have seemed most valuable during the first decade or so of life.
The current emphasis on standardized testing highlights analysis and procedure, meaning that few of us inherently use our innovative and collaborative modes of thought. "This breaks the major rule in the American belief system ― that anyone can do anything," explains M. J. Ryan, author of the 2006 book This Year I Will... and Ms. Markova's business partner. "That's a lie that we have perpetuated, and it fosters commonness. Knowing what you're good at and doing even more of it creates excellence." This is where developing new habits comes in.

21.	The Wordsworth’s view, “habits” is claimed by being ________.
A. casual       B. familiar     C. mechanical    D. changeable
22.	Brain researchers have discovered that the formation of new habits can be ________
A. predicted    B. regulated    C. traced        D. guided
23.	The word "ruts"( Line 1, Paragraph 4) is closest meaning to ________
A. tracks       B. series       C. characteristics  D. connections
24.	Dawna Markova would most probably agree that ________.
A. ideas are born of a relaxing mind
B. innovativeness could be taught
C. decisiveness derives from fantastic ideas
D. curiosity activates creative minds
25.	Ryan's comments suggest that the practice of standardized testing ________
A, prevents new habits form being formed
B, no longer emphasizes commonness
C, maintains the inherent American thinking model
D, complies with the American belief system

It is a wise father that knows his own child, but today a man can boost his paternal (fatherly) wisdom C or at least confirm that he's the kid's dad. All he needs to do is shell our $30 for paternity testing kit (PTK) at his local drugstore C and another $120 to get the results.
More than 60,000 people have purchased the PTKs since they first become available without prescriptions last years, according to Doug Fog, chief operating officer of Identigene, which makes the over-the-counter kits. More than two dozen companies sell DNA tests Directly to the public , ranging in price from a few hundred dollars to more than $2,500.
Among the most popular: paternity and kinship testing , which adopted children can use to find their biological relatives and families can use to track down kids put up for adoption. DNA testing is also the latest rage among passionate genealogists―and supports businesses that offer to search for a family's geographic roots .
Most tests require collecting cells by swabbing saliva in the mouth and sending it to the company for testing.  All tests require a potential candidate with whom to compare DNA.
But some observers are skeptical, "There is a kind of false precision being hawked by people claiming they are doing ancestry testing," says Trey Duster, a New York University sociologist. He notes that each individual has many ancestors-numbering in the hundreds just a few centuries back. Yet most ancestry testing only considers a single lineage, either the Y chromosome inherited through men in a father's line or mitochondrial DNA, which is passed down only from mothers. This DNA can reveal genetic information about only one or two ancestors, even though, for example, just three generations back people also have six other great-grandparents or, four generations back, 14 other great-great-grandparents.
Critics also argue that commercial genetic testing is only as good as the reference collections to which a sample is compared. Databases used by some companies don't rely on data collected systematically but rather lump together information from different research projects. This means that a DNA database may have a lot of data from some regions and not others, so a person’s test results may differ depending on the company that processes the results. In addition, the computer programs a company uses to estimate relationships may be patented and not subject to peer review or outside evaluation.
26.	In paragraphs 1 and 2, the text shows PTK's ___________.
[A] easy availability
[B] flexibility in pricing
[C] successful promotion
[D] popularity with households

[B] rebuild reliable bloodlines
[C] fully use genetic information
[D] achieve the claimed accuracy
29.	In the last paragraph, a problem commercial genetic testing faces is __________.
[A] disorganized data collection

[C] excessive sample comparison
[D] lack of patent evaluation

Text 3
The relationship between formal education and economic growth in poor countries is widely misunderstood by economists and politicians alike. Progress in both area is undoubtedly necessary for the social, political and intellectual development of these and all other societies; however, the conventional view that education should be one of the very highest priorities for promoting rapid economic development in poor countries is wrong. We are fortunate that is it, because building new educational systems there and putting enough people through them to improve economic performance would require two or three generations. The findings of a research institution have consistently shown that workers in all countries can be trained on the job to achieve radically higher productivity and, as a result, radically higher standards of living.
Ironically, the first evidence for this idea appeared in the United States. Not long ago, with the country entering a recessing and Japan at its pre-bubble peak. The U.S. workforce was derided as poorly educated and one of the primary cause of the poor U.S. economic performance. Japan was, and remains, the global leader in automotive-assembly productivity. Yet the research revealed that the U.S. factories of Honda, Nissan, and Toyota achieved about 95 percent of the productivity of their Japanese counterparts -- a result of the training that U.S. workers received on the job.
More recently, while examining housing construction, the researchers discovered that illiterate, non-English- speaking Mexican workers in Houston, Texas, consistently met best-practice labor productivity standards despite the complexity of the building industry's work.
What is the real relationship between education and economic development? We have to suspect that continuing economic growth promotes the development of education even when governments don't force it. After all, that's how education got started. When our ancestors were hunters and gatherers 10,000 years ago, they didn't have time to wonder much about anything besides finding food. Only when humanity began to get its food in a more productive way was there time for other things.
As education improved, humanity's productivity potential increased as well. When the competitive environment pushed our ancestors to achieve that potential, they could in turn afford more education. This increasingly high level of education is probably a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for the complex political systems required by advanced economic performance. Thus poor countries might not be able to escape their poverty traps without political changes that may be possible only with broader formal education. A lack of formal education, however, doesn't constrain the ability of the developing world's workforce to substantially improve productivity for the foreseeable future. On the contrary, constraints on improving productivity explain why education isn't developing more quickly there than it is.
31.	The author holds in paragraph 1 that the important of education in poor countries  ___________.
[A] is subject groundless doubts
[B] has fallen victim of bias
[C] is conventional downgraded
[D] has been overestimated
32.	It is stated in Paragraph 1 that construction of a new education system  __________.
[A] challenges economists and politicians
[B] takes efforts of generations
[C] demands priority from the government
[D] requires sufficient labor force
33.	A major difference between the Japanese and U.S workforces is that __________.
[A] the Japanese workforce is better disciplined
[B] the Japanese workforce is more productive
[C] the U.S workforce has a better education
[D] the U.S workforce is more organize
34.	The author quotes the example of our ancestors to show that education emerged __________.
[A] when people had enough time
[B] prior to better ways of finding food
[C] when people on longer went hung
[D] as a result of pressure on government
35.	According to the last paragraph , development of education __________.
[A] results directly from competitive environments
[B] does not depend on economic performance
[C] follows improved productivity
[D] cannot afford political changes
Text 4
The most thoroughly studied intellectuals in the history of the New World are the ministers and political leaders of seventeenth-century New England. According to the standard history of American philosophy, nowhere else in colonial America was "So much importance attached to intellectual pursuits. " According to many books and articles, New England's leaders established the basic themes and preoccupations of an unfolding, dominant Puritan tradition in American intellectual life.
To take this approach to the New Englanders normally means to start with the Puritans' theological innovations and their distinctive ideas about the church-important subjects that we may not neglect. But in keeping with our examination of southern intellectual life, we may consider the original Puritans as carriers of European culture, adjusting to New World circumstances. The New England colonies were the scenes of important episodes in the pursuit of widely understood ideals of civility and virtuosity.
The early settlers of Massachusetts Bay included men of impressive education and influence in England. Besides the ninety or so learned ministers who came to Massachusetts church in the decade after 1629,There were political leaders like John Winthrop, an educated gentleman, lawyer, and official of the Crown before he journeyed to Boston. There men wrote and published extensively, reaching both New World and Old World audiences, and giving New England an atmosphere of intellectual earnestness.
We should not forget , however, that most New Englanders were less well educated. While few craftsmen or farmers, let alone dependents and servants, left literary compositions to be analyzed, it is obvious that their views were less fully intellectualized. Their thinking often had a traditional superstitions quality. A tailor named John Dane, who emigrated in the late 1630s, left an account of his reasons for leaving England that is filled with signs. Sexual confusion, economic frustrations , and religious hope―all came together in a decisive moment when he opened the Bible, told his father the first line he saw would settle his fate, and read the magical words: "come out from among them, touch no unclean thing , and I will be your God and you shall be my people." One wonders what Dane thought of the careful sermons explaining the Bible that he heard in puritan churches.
Meanwhile, many settles had slighter religious commitments than Dane's, as one clergyman learned in confronting folk along the coast who mocked that they had not come to the New world for religion . "Our main end was to catch fish. "
36.	The author notes that in the seventeenth-century New England___________.
[A] Puritan tradition dominated political life.
[B] intellectual interests were encouraged.
[C] Politics benefited much from intellectual endeavors.
[D] intellectual pursuits enjoyed a liberal environment.
37.	It is suggested in paragraph 2 that New Englanders__________.
[A] experienced a comparatively peaceful early history.
[B] brought with them the culture of the Old World
[C] paid little attention to southern intellectual life
[D] were obsessed with religious innovations
38.	The early ministers and political leaders in Massachusetts Bay__________.
[A] were famous in the New World for their writings
[B] gained increasing importance in religious affairs
[C] abandoned high positions before coming to the New World
[D] created a new intellectual atmosphere in New England
39.	The story of John Dane shows that less well-educated New Englanders were often __________.
[A] influenced by superstitions
[B] troubled with religious beliefs
[C] puzzled by church sermons
[D] frustrated with family earnings
40.	The text suggests that early settlers in New England__________.
[A] were mostly engaged in political activities
[B] were motivated by an illusory prospect
[C] came from different backgrounds.
[D] left few formal records for later reference

Coinciding with the groundbreaking theory of biological evolution proposed by British naturalist Charles Darwin in the 1860s, British social philosopher Herbert Spencer put forward his own theory of biological and cultural evolution. Spencer argued that all worldly phenomena, including human societies, changed over time, advancing toward perfection. 41.____________.
American social scientist Lewis Henry Morgan introduced another theory of cultural evolution in the late 1800s. Morgan, along with Tylor, was one of the founders of modern anthropology. In his work, he attempted to show how all aspects of culture changed together in the evolution of societies.42._____________.
In the early 1900s in North America, German-born American anthropologist Franz Boas developed a new theory of culture known as historical particularism. Historical particularism, which emphasized the uniqueness of all cultures, gave new direction to anthropology. 43._____________.
Boas felt that the culture of any society must be understood as the result of a unique history and not as one of many cultures belonging to a broader evolutionary stage or type of culture. 44._______________.
Historical particularism became a dominant approach to the study of culture in American anthropology, largely through the influence of many students of Boas. But a number of anthropologists in the early 1900s also rejected the particularist theory of culture in favor of diffusionism. Some attributed virtually every important cultural achievement to the inventions of a few, especially gifted peoples that, according to diffusionists, then spread to other cultures. 45.________________.
Also in the early 1900s, French sociologist émile Durkheim developed a theory of culture that would greatly influence anthropology. Durkheim proposed that religious beliefs functioned to reinforce social solidarity. An interest in the relationship between the function of society and culture―known as functionalism―became a major theme in European, and especially British, anthropology.
[A]	Other anthropologists believed that cultural innovations, such as inventions, had a single origin and passed from society to society. This theory was known as diffusionism.
[B]	In order to study particular cultures as completely as possible, Boas became skilled in linguistics, the study of languages, and in physical anthropology, the study of human biology and anatomy.
[C]	He argued that human evolution was characterized by a struggle he called the "survival of the fittest," in which weaker races and societies must eventually be replaced by stronger, more advanced races and societies.
[D]	They also focused on important rituals that appeared to preserve a people's social structure, such as initiation ceremonies that formally signify children's entrance into adulthood.
[E]	Thus, in his view, diverse aspects of culture, such as the structure of families, forms of marriage, categories of kinship, ownership of property, forms of government, technology, and systems of food production, all changed as societies evolved.
[F]	Supporters of the theory viewed as a collection of integrated parts that work together to keep a society functioning.
[G]	For example, British anthropologists Grafton Elliot Smith and W. J. Perry incorrectly suggested, on the basis of inadequate information, that farming, pottery making, and metallurgy all originated in ancient Egypt and diffused throughout the world. In fact, all of these cultural developments occurred separately at different times in many parts of the world.

There is a marked difference between the education which everyone gets from living with others, and the deliberate educating of the young. In the former case the education is incidental; it is natural and important, but it is not the express reason of the association. (46) It may be said that the measure of the worth of any social institution is its effect in enlarging and improving experience; but this effect is not a part of its original motive. Religious associations began, for example, in the desire to secure the favor of overruling powers and to ward off evil influences; family life in the desire to gratify appetites and secure family perpetuity; systematic labor, for the most part, because of enslavement to others, etc. (47) Only gradually was the by-product of the institution noted, and only more gradually still was this effect considered as a directive factor in the conduct of the institution. Even today, in our industrial life, apart from certain values of industriousness and thrift, the intellectual and emotional reaction of the forms of human association under which the world's work is carried on receives little attention as compared with physical output.
But in dealing with the young, the fact of association itself as an immediate human fact, gains in importance. (48) While it is easy to ignore in our contact with them the effect of our acts upon their disposition, it is not so easy as in dealing with adults. The need of training is too evident; the pressure to accomplish a change in their attitude and habits is too urgent to leave these consequences wholly out of account. (49) Since our chief business with them is to enable them to share in a common life we cannot help considering whether or no we are forming the powers which will secure this ability.If humanity has made some headway in realizing that the ultimate value of every institution is its distinctively human effect we may well believe that this lesson has been learned largely through dealings with the young.
(50) We are thus led to distinguish, within the broad educational process which we have been so far considering, a more formal kind of education -- that of direct tuition or schooling. In undeveloped social groups, we find very little formal teaching and training. These groups mainly rely for instilling needed dispositions into the young upon the same sort of association which keeps the adults loyal to their group.

2009年全国硕士研究生入学统一考试答案详解
Section I: Use of English(10 points)
1.【答案】[B]
【解析】词义辨析题。本题考查动词词义，Suppose假设， Observe观察， Imagine想象，Consider 考虑，后面的宾语是“ the fruit-fly experiments described in Carl Zimmer in the Science Times”，即“”，后面接着说了实验的结果及其含义。将四个选项代入文中，最符合符合语境的就是Consider考虑，这句话的意思是“让我们考虑考虑卡尔?齐默发表在《科学时代》杂志上的文章所描述的果蝇试验”。 
2.【答案】[A] 
　 【解析】惯用衔接题。本题考查动词短语， tend to 表示“有 … 倾向，往往 … ”， fear to表示“唯恐 …  ”，happen to表示“碰巧…”， be threatened to 表示“被恐吓 … ”。文中表示比较聪明的果蝇往往比普通果蝇寿命较短，填tend to符合题意，这句话的意思是“受到训练的果蝇要比普通果蝇聪明，但寿命往往比普通果蝇短”。 
3. 【答案】[D] 
【解析】词义辨析题。本题考查形容词， lighter 更轻的， thinner 更瘦的， stabler 更稳定的， dimmer 比较暗淡的。本句是前一句推出的结论，即由“果蝇越聪明寿命越短” 推出 “灯泡越暗使用时间越长”，故选D符合题意。lighter，thinner，stabler 一般不用于修饰bulb（灯泡）。这句话的意思是“这表明暗淡的灯泡使用时间会更长”。 
4. 【答案】[B] 
【解析】逻辑推理题。  本题考查逻辑关系和词义辨析，tendency 倾向， advantage 优势， inclination 倾向， priority 优先权。由前半句 “bulbs burn longer” (灯泡越暗使用时间越长)推出“这是不特别亮的灯泡的一个优点”，因此advantage最符合题意。这句话的意思是“同时也表明不那么明亮其实是灯泡的一个优势”。 
5. 【答案】[C] 
【解析】词义辨析题。本题考查动词短语， turns out 证明是，结果是， insist on 坚持， sum up 总结， put forward 提出。根据第一段的内容，Fruit flies who were taught to be smarter than the average fruit fly tend to live shorter lives. This suggests that dimmer bulbs burn longer, that there is an advantage in not being too bright. 即果蝇越聪明寿命越短，灯泡越暗淡使用时间越长，可以证明智力是要付出代价的，因此turn out符合这儿的意思。这句话的意思是“事实证明，智力是要付出昂贵的代价的”。  
6. 【答案】[A] 
【解析】逻辑衔接题。本题考查介词，off 表示“离开”，behind表示“在…之后”，over表示“在…之上”，along表示“沿着…”。根据上下文可知，这儿表示离开起点时，off比较合适。而along是沿着，沿着起点意思上说不过去，故只能选off。这句话的意思是“它需要更高的给养、消耗更多的燃料，离开起点时速度比较缓慢”。  
7. 【答案】[D] 
【解析】词义辨析题。  本题考查形容词。incredible 难以置信的， spontaneous 自发的， inevitable 不可避免的， gradual 渐进的。根据文中的意思，智力取决于学习，而学习是一个渐进的过程，所以选 gradual。这句话的意思是“这是因为智力依靠的是学习（一个循序渐进的过程）而不是一种本能”。 
8. 【答案】[C] 
【解析】逻辑推理题。本文的主旨是智力需要昂贵的代价。大量的物种会学习，但它们首先学会的是知道什么时候停止学习，与上文的例子灯泡呼应。四个选项中， fight 斗争， doubt 怀疑，stop 停止，think 思考，正确答案为 C。这句话的意思是“许多其他的物种也有学习的能力，很显然他们学到的东西之一就是知道何时停止”。 
9. 【答案】[B] 
【解析】语义搭配题。本题考查形容词，修饰 intelligence 。 invisible 看不见的， indefinite 不确定的，这两个选项意思不符合，可以首先排除。 different 不同的， limited 有限的，都可以与intelligence搭配，但是，通读上下文，会发现这里要强调的并不是不同的物种智力不同，而是所有物种的智力都是有限的，所以 limited 符合文意。这句话的意思是“有限的智力是否有适应值呢？” 
10. 【答案】[D] 
【解析】固定搭配题。本题考查固定搭配，cast a glance backward 意思为“回顾”。其他选项：upward 向上，forward向前，afterward后来，都不能与之搭配。这句话的意思是“不是去回顾那些智商远远落后于我们的那些物种”。 
11. 【答案】[D] 
【解析】词义辨析题。本题考查名词，feature 特征， influence 影响， result 结果， cost 代价。根据前文可以知道，聪明是有代价的：比如果蝇越聪明寿命越短，因而 cost “代价”与文
中“事实证明，智力是要付出代价”相呼应, 符合文章主旨。这句话的意思是“它（这个研究）含蓄地问我们自己智力的真正代价是什么。” 
12. 【答案】[B] 
【解析】惯用搭配题。本题考查介词，on the mind of sb.表示“挂在某人心上，使某人担心”， by the mind “通过思考”， across 常用于come across one’s mind短语中，表示“忽然想到”outside 不与 mind 的搭配。 前面一句说到人们问自己智力真正的代价是什么的问题，这一句紧接上文，说这个问题也是我们所遇到的每个动物所关心的问题，也就是每个动物都挂在心上的，因此on the mind of every animal符合题意。这句话的意思是“我们见过的每种动物都有这种想法”。  
13. 【答案】[C] 
【解析】惯用搭配题。本题考查动词，与之搭配的宾语是 experiments ，选项中只有perform 能与 experiments 搭配，表示“做实验”。 deliver 递送， carry 运送， apply 应用，都不与experiment搭配。这句话的意思是“如果动物有机会的话，他们会对人类作什么样的实验”。   
14.【答案】[D] 
【解析】逻辑衔接题。本题考查介词短语，属逻辑衔接题。前一句提到 experiments ，本句提到一个具体的实验，所以选 for instance 例如，表示举例说明。 其他短语意思：by chance 偶然， in contrast 相反，as usual 像往常一样。这句话的意思是“比如说，每只有主人的猫都在进行一个小型的操作性条件反射研究”。 
15.【答案】[A] 
【解析】逻辑衔接题。本题考查连词，由后半句中 they would test us to 可推测本句使用了虚拟语气，选项中 if 可以引导虚拟条件句。 unless 除非， as 正如， lest 唯恐。这句话的意思是“如果动物进行试验”。 
 16.【答案】[C] 
【解析】语义推理题。本题考查动词，所填动词应表明实验的目的，并且所填动词的宾语是 limits of our patience, our faithfulness, our memory for terrain ，选项中“ determine 确定”符合题意，并与下文的 decide 相呼应。 moderate 减轻，缓和， overcome 克服， reach 达到。本句的意思是“他们会测定我们的忍耐度，忠诚度，以及对地形的记忆力”。 
17. 【答案】[B] 
【解析】介词辨析题。本题考查介词，四个选项中 for 表示目的，这个句子的正常句序是 intelligence in humans is really for what，即人类智力的真正用处是什么。at 在，于；after在…之后； with同…一起。这句话的意思是“他们会试图判定人类智力的真正用处是什么”。 
18.【答案】[A] 
【解析】逻辑推理题。本题考查逻辑关系。这个句子位于段末，显然起到总结性的作用。四个选项中， Above all 最重要， After all 毕竟， However 然而， Otherwise 否则。根据上下文，本句意思应该是“最重要的是，他们希望研究一个最基本的问题”，故选 Above all 。  
19.【答案】[A] 
【解析】词义辨析题。本题考查形容词，修饰 question 。 fundamental 基本的， comprehensive 全面的， equivalent 相等的， hostile 敌对的。由句后问题的内容Are humans actually aware of the world they live in（人类是否真正意识到了自己所生存的世界），可推出这是一个最基本和重要的问题，所以选 fundamental。本句的意思是“他们希望研究一个最基本的问题”。  
20.【答案】[C] 
【解析】逻辑衔接与词义辨析题。本题考查副词。空前说“想研究这个问题”，空后说“结果还不确定”。四个选项中， By accident “偶然”， In time “及时”， So far “到目前为止”， Better still “更好的是”，只有 So far 符合语意。这句话的意思是“对此，目前仍无定论”。   

Section II Reading Comprehension
Part A
Text 1 
参考译文： 习惯是件非常奇妙的事。我们的习惯在无意识的状态下就能行成，习惯使我们的头脑处于自动导航状态，并且放松地进入一种无意识的惯性的舒适之中。威廉?华兹华斯早在19世纪就说过：“不是选择而是习惯主宰着不会思考的兽群。”在日新月异的21世纪，甚至连“习惯”这个词都散发着消极的含义。 
因此，在谈论创造力和革新的背景下讨论习惯问题，似乎有点自相矛盾。但是脑科研究人员已经发现，当我们有意识地培养新习惯时，大脑内就会生成平行路径，甚至全新的脑细胞，这些脑细胞能将我们的思维导向全新的、富有创意的轨道。 
与其认为我们固有的习惯不可更改，不如通过有意识地培养新习惯以做出改变。事实上，我们尝试的新事物越多，也就是说，我们越远离自己的舒适范围，不论在职场上还是在个人生活上，我们就越具有创造性。 
但是，我们也不必费心地去摈弃旧有的习惯；一旦形成思维定式，它们就将永久地被储存在大脑。相反，我们刻意培养的新习惯能生成平行思维路径，这些思维路径会避开那些旧有的路径。 
《开放的心灵》一书的作者朵娜?马可瓦说：“创新的首要条件就是酷爱非凡的事物。但我们接受的教育不是要求我们热爱非凡事物而是要求我们‘做出决定’，正如我们的老板称自己是‘决策者’一样。”然而，她补充说道：“决策意味着保留一种可能而摈弃所有其他的可能。一名出色的创新思想者总是试图探索很多其他的可能性选择。” 
她说，我们所有的人都是以自己没有觉察到的方法来解决问题的。20世纪60年代晚期，研究者们发现,人类天生就能以四种主要的方法来解决面临的挑战。这四种方法是：分析法、程序法、相关法（又称相互协作法）和革新法。然而，在青春期就要结束时，大脑就关闭了其中的两种功能，只保留了在生命最初的十几年里看起来似乎最有价值的思维方法。 
现在，人们强调标准测试，这实际上突出了分析和程式，意味着很少有人天生就使用创新和相互协作的思维模式。M.J.?赖安是2006年出版的《今年我打算…》一书的作者，也是马可瓦女士的生意伙伴，她说：“这有悖于美国信仰体系的主要信仰，即每个人都无所不能。这是我们长久以来编造的一个谎言，这个谎言造就了平庸。了解自己擅长什么并且在此方面更加努力就能走向卓越。”这才正是培养新习惯的开端。
21．【答案】[C] 
【解析】事实细节题。意为： 华兹华斯认为,习惯的特点就是 
本题问的是Wordsworth对habit的观点，根据人名定位到第一段，“Not choice, but habit rules the unreflecting herd,” William Wordsworth said in the 19th century（威廉?华兹华斯早在19世纪就说过：“不是选择而是习惯主宰着不会思考的兽群”）。选项[C] mechanical (机械的)可以说是对unreflecting的替换。此外文章第二句中提到 We reach for them mindlessly, setting our brains on auto-pilot and relaxing into the unconscious comfort of familiar routine（我们的习惯在无意识的状态下就能行成，习惯使我们的头脑处于自动导航状态，并且放松地进入一种无意识的惯性的舒适之中），从这个表述中可以看出习惯的形成过程完全是一种无意状态下的机械活动。因此，正确选项为[C]。[A] casual不经意的，[B] familiar熟悉的， [D] changeable可变化的。
22.【答案】[D] 
【解析】事实细节题。意为：脑研究者发现，习惯的形成可以被 
我们定位到第二段So it seems antithetical to talk about habits in the same context as creativity and innovation. But brain researchers have discovered that when we consciously develop new habits, we create parallel synaptic paths, and even entirely new brain cells, that can jump our trains of thought onto new, innovative tracks. （因此，在谈论创造力和革新的背景下讨论习惯问题，似乎有点自相矛盾。但是脑科研究人员已经发现，当我们有意识地培养新习惯时，大脑内就会生成平行路径，甚至全新的脑细胞，这些脑细胞能将我们的思维导向全新的、富有创意的轨道。）第一句说creativity 和innovation 与habit是互不相容的，接着文章用but表示转折，在这种情况下我们可以推测后面的内容是讲creativity 和innovation与habit是相容的，研究者发现了什么呢？当我们有意识地(consciously)形成新的习惯时，我们甚至能够创造全新的脑细胞，这能够将我们的思绪导向全新的、富有创意的轨道。由此可见研究人员认为习惯的形成是可以被引导的。故[D]guided引导的是正确选项。[A] predicted预见的，[B] regulated管理的，[C] traced 追踪的。
23.【答案】[A] 
【解析】 词义推断题。意为：“ruts”这个词在意思上最贴近于 
解析：本题为词义推断题，必须从上下文中加以理解，But don’t bother trying to kill off old habits; once those ruts of procedure are worn into the hippocampus, they’re there to stay. 
Instead, the new habits we deliberately ingrain into ourselves create parallel pathways that can bypass those old roads（但是，我们也不必费心地去摈弃旧有的习惯；一旦形成思维定式，它们就将永久地被储存在大脑的海马区。相反，我们刻意培养的新习惯能生成平行思维路径将，这些思维路径会避开那些旧有的路径），首先我们由they’re there to stay，知道ruts是一个具体的东西，接着由the new habits create parallel pathways that can bypass those old roads.我们可以知道ruts与pathways和roads应该是同义替换的，由此选择[A]tracks痕迹，轨迹。[B]series系列，[C]characteristics特点，[D]connections联系。
24. 【答案】[D] 
【解析】事实细节题。意为：朵娜?马可瓦最可能同意
根据人名Dawna Markova我们可以定位到最第5段，由“The first thing needed for innovation is a fascination with wonder,” says Dawna Markova（Markova说认为创新最需要的就是对非凡事情的着迷），因此选[D]curiosity activates creative minds。而 [A] ideas are born of a relaxing mind观点来源于放松的头脑，是利用文中出现的relaxing加以编制的选项，文中没有对应的句子[B] innovative- ness could be taught创新能够被传授，虽然文中最后一段Knowing what you’re good at and doing even more of it creates excellence.” This is where developing new habits comes in（了解自己擅长什么并且在此方面更加努力就能走向卓越。”这才正是培养新习惯的开端），但只是说doing even more of it creates excellence.并没有交代是本人自觉地多做，还是被“taught”地多做。[C] decisiveness derives from fantastic ideas果断来自于奇特的想法，文中没有关于果断的信息。
25. 【答案】[A] 
【解析】事实细节题。意为：赖安的评论意味着标准化测试
本题难度较大，可以通过排除法做出选择。我们首先找到文中关于标准化测试的描述The current emphasis on standardized testing highlights analysis and procedure, meaning that few of us inherently use our innovative and collaborative modes of thought.大意为目前标准化测试只强调了analysis与procedure，这从根本上使得很少有人能够使用 innovative与collaborative的思维模式，而前面一段提到，人天生的思维模式包含四种，因此[C] maintains the inherent American thinking model坚持天生的美国思维模式不正确；接着我们找到Ryan的评论，This breaks the major rule in the American belief system ― that anyone can do anything. That’s a lie that we have perpetuated, and it fosters commonness. Knowing what you’re good at and doing even more of it creates excellence. 由第一句，“这有悖于美国信仰体系的主要信仰，即每个人都无所不能，”我们可以判断 [D] complies with the American belief system与美国的信仰体系一致这个选项不正确；第二句“这是我们长久以来编造的一个谎言，这个谎言造就了平庸”，可以断定[B] no longer emphasizes commonness不再强调平庸也不正确；只剩下[A] prevents new habits from being formed阻止了新习惯的形成。那么从文中哪地方可以判断[A]正确呢。请看Ryan评论的最后一句话，“了解自己擅长什么并且在此方面更加努力就能走向卓越”以及文章最后一句话，This is where developing new habits comes in. 这才正是培养新习惯的开端。这句话紧跟在Ryan的评论之后，是对其评论的总结和意义所在。因此[A]项正确。

Text 2
节选自2008年11月14日的《科学美国人》题目为Who's Your Daddy? The Answer May Be at the Drugstore.（谁是你父亲？答案或许就在药店）。这是一篇科普类文章，介绍了在美国基因检测血缘关系的技术的普及以及其局限性和问题。
参考译文：
了解自己的孩子的父亲是明智的父亲，但现在人们可以提升自己作为父亲的智慧---或者至少证实自己是孩子的爸爸。他只需付30美元即可在当地的药店买一套亲子关系鉴定包（PTK）-- 另外再付120美元就可得到鉴定结果。
身份基因公司是一家生产不需处方可以直接出售的PTK的公司。该公司的首席运营官达格佛格说，自从去年不需要处方即购可买之后，己经超过 6 万人购买了 PTK。有二十多家公司直接向公众出售DNA鉴定，价格从几百美元到2500美元不等。
其中最受欢迎的是父子血缘鉴定。被收养的孩子可以通过它来找到与自己具有血缘关系的亲属，收养孩子的家庭也可以通过它来了解收养孩子的情况。DNA鉴定最近也引起了谱系学者的强烈愤怒，因为它支持提供寻找家族的祖籍服务的生意。
大部分的鉴定需要通过从口中拭取唾液来收集细胞，然后送往公司进行检测。所有的这些检测都需要有一个潜在的候选人以便与他的DNA进行比对。
但是有些观察者对此持怀疑态度。纽约大学的社会学家特洛伊?达斯特说：“那些正在做祖先鉴定的人们所宣扬的祖先鉴定的精确度其实是错的。”他注意到，每个人都有很多的祖先---往前推几百年就可以找到成百的祖先。然而，大多数祖先鉴定只考虑一个世系，或者是通过男子继承的父亲方面的Y染色体，或者是从母亲一方遗传下来的线粒体DNA。这种DNA只能显示约一到两个祖先的基因信息，即使还会有六个其他的曾祖父母或者有14个其他的曾曾祖父母，假如我们仅往前推三代或者四代的话。
批评家还认为，商业基因鉴定实际上只相当于拿样本进行比对的参考信息。有些公司使用的数据库并不依赖于系统的数据收集而是把不同研究机构收集的信息合在一起。这就意味着处理数据的公司不同，所用 DNA 数据库也会不同。另外，一个公司用来鉴定血缘关系的计算机程序可能是受到专利保护的，不能受制于同行的评论和外部的评价。

26. 【答案】[A] 
【解析】推理判断题。意为：文章第一、二段表明了PTK 的
文章首段最后一句话All he needs to do is shell out $30 for paternity testing kit (PTK) at his local drugstore C and another $120 to get the results（只需花 30 美元在地方药房作亲子鉴定-- 另外再付120美元就可得到鉴定结果），第二段第一句More than 60,000people have purchased the PTKs since they first become available without prescriptions last year（自从去年不需要处方即购可买之后，己经超过 6 万人购买了 PTK ）。可以知道文章第一、二段主要说明了PTK很容易买到，因此选项[A] easy availability容易得到为正确答案。从第二段整段我们可以看出，关于鉴定价格浮动只在第二段最后一句有所体现，因而[B] flexibility in pricing灵活的价格不能算一、二段的大意；[C]successful promotion成功促销文中未提到；[D]popularity with households受家庭欢迎属过度推断。
27. 【答案】[C] 
【解析】事实细节题。意为： PTK 是用来
从文中第三段Among the most popular: paternity and kinship testing, which adopted children can use to find their biological relatives（被收养的孩子可以通过亲子鉴定找到他具有血缘关系的亲属），这个意思同[C] identify parent-child kinship鉴定亲子关系的表述是一致的。[A] locate one’s birth place寻找一个人的出生地这个选项比较具有迷惑性，从第三段最后一句话DNA testing is also the latest rage among passionate genealogists --- and supports businesses that offer to search for a family’s geographic roots （PTK 最近惹怒了很多谱系学家，它支持提供寻找家族的祖籍服务的生意），.我们可以看出， PTK 没有主要被用来寻找一个人的出生地，因而排除；选项[B] promote genetic research促进基因研究，[D] choose children for adoption选择收养的孩子文中均未提及。
28. 【答案】[D] 
【解析】事实细节题。意为：持怀疑态度的观察者认为祖先鉴定没有
从题干信息我们可以将它定位到文中第五段第一句There is a kind of false precision being hawked by people claiming they are doing ancestry testing（那些正在做祖先鉴定的人们所宣扬的（祖先鉴定）精确度其实是错的），这句话是对这一段的概括，因此[D]achieve the claimed accuracy达到声称的准确性符合上述意思。而[A]trace distant ancestors找寻遥远的祖先，[B] rebuild reliable bloodlines重建可靠的血缘关系，[C] fully use genetic information充分利用基因信息都只是它的细节之一，不能作为概括表述。
29. 【答案】[A] 
【解析】事实细节题。意为：最后一段中商业基因鉴定面临的一个问题是
从最后一段第二句Databases used by some companies don’t rely on data collected systematically but rather lump together information from different research projects. This means that a DNA database may differ depending on the company that processes the results（一些公司使用的数据库并不依赖于系统的数据收集而是把不同研究机构收集的信息合在一起。这就意味着处理数据的公司不同，所用 DNA 数据库也会不同），可以断定[A]disorganized data collection数椐收集的紊乱与本句话意思基本一致，为正确答案。文中并未提及数据是否重合，[B] overlapping database building 重合的数据库建设无根椐。[C] excessive sample comparison 过多的样本比对 [D] lack of patent evaluation 缺少专利评价文中没有体现。
30. 【答案】[B] 
【解析】主旨大意题。意为：本文最合适的题目应是
本题考察对文章主旨的把握，通读全文，我们看不到有明显赞成 DNA 测试的倾向，因此[A] Fors and Againsts of DNA Testing  DNA 测试的赞成与反对不能概括文章大意；同样，文中没有特别强调实验室内外的问题，因而也可排除[C] DNA Testing Outside the Lab  实验室外的DNA测试；文中作者只是客观地提出了 DNA 测试存在的不准确性问题，但并没有指明是哪些人的谎言，因而[D] Lies Behind DNA Testing  DNA 测试背后的谎言也不能算对；文章首先说到了PTK很容易得到，亲子血缘鉴定最受欢迎，接着说明了持怀疑态度的人们的看法，虚假的精确性与数据库的紊乱。因此[B] DNA Testing and Its Problems  DNA 测试及它存在的问题最能概括文章的大意，是文章最合适的题目。

Text 3
节选自2003年12月Mckinsey Quarterly 《麦肯锡季刊》原文题目为Educating Global Workers(全球工人的教育)。文章驳斥了一般认为发展教育可以带来经济增长的观点，指出持续的经济发展可以促进教育的发展，但缺少正规教育并不会限制发展中世界工人为可预见的将来大幅度提高生产力的能力。
参考译文：
正规教育和经济发展的关系在贫困国家普遍遭到经济学家和政治家的误解。毫无疑问，教育和经济的进步对于这些贫困国家以及其他所有国家的社会、政治和智力发展都是必不可少的；但是，认为在贫困国家极应优先发展教育以促进经济的快速发展的传统观点是错误的。我们很幸运这种看法是错误的，这是因为，在贫困国家建立新的教育制度并且让足够多的人们接受教育从而促进经济绩效需要两到三代人的努力。一个研究机构的发现一直在向我们表明，所有国家的工人都可以通过在岗培训极大地提高生产力，从而极大地提高人们的生活水准。
具有讽刺意味的是，这种观点的第一个证据是在美国出现的。不久前，美国进入经济萧条，而日本处于泡沫前的经济发展高峰，人们认为之所以如此，是由于美国工人教育程度低，从而造成了美国较差的经济发展。在汽车生产方面，日本过去是而且现在仍保持全球领先地位。但是研究表明，工人在接受岗上培训后，美国的本田、尼桑和丰田汽车生产厂家达到了日本同类汽车生产厂家大约95%的生产率。
还有一个更近的证据。在对住宅建设的检查中，研究人员发现，虽然建筑行业的工作极其复杂，但是在休斯敦和得克萨斯两地的墨西哥建筑工人，尽管没有文化，不会说英语却始终能达到最优劳动生产率标准。
教育和经济发展的真正关系是什么呢？我们不得不相信，持续的经济发展可以促进教育的发展，即使政府不施加压力。毕竟，这才是教育开始的方式。一万年前，当我们的祖先依靠狩猎和采集生活时，他们没有时间思考找寻食物之外的任何事情。只有在他们以一种更加高产的方式获得食物之后，才有从事其他事情的时间。
随着教育的发展，人类的生产潜力也得到提高。只有当竞争性环境促使我们的祖先达到他们的生产潜力时，他们才能反过来负担得起教育。高层次教育的不断发展或许是先进的经济绩效所要求的复杂政治制度的必要但不是充分条件。因此，假如没有那些只有在有了更广泛的正规教育之后才可能发生的政治变化，贫困国家或许就不能够逃脱它们贫困的命运。然而，缺少正规教育并不会限制发展中世界工人为可预见的将来大幅度提高生产力的能力。相反，对提高生产力的限制解释了发展中国家的教育为什么没有比实际发展得更加迅速。

31. 【答案】[D] 
【解析】推理判断题目。意为：在第一段作者认为在贫困国家教育的重要性
作者在首段指出however, the conventional view that education should be one of the very highest priorities for promoting rapid economic development in poor countries is wrong（但是，传统的观点认为在贫困国家对促进经济的快速发展而言，教育是极应优先考虑的要素之一，这是种错误的看法），教育的优先性和教育的重要性实际上是一个意思，而既然文中说优先教育是种错误的看法，由此可推出教育的重要性被过度的重视了即被高估了，因此 [D] has been overestimated 被高估正确。[A] is subject to groundless doubts 受到无根据的怀疑不正确；[B] has fallen victim of bias 成为偏见的牺牲品 [C] is conventionally downgraded 被降低表述的意思文中没有提及。
32.【答案】[B] 
【解析】事实细节题。意为：第一段表明建立新的教育体系________。
在第一段作者主要谈论了靠优先发展教育来促进经济发展是错误的看法，而世界各国的工人经过了劳动培训可以获取高生产率进而带来更高的生活水平。解答细节题时同样明显背离中心的选项可首先排除，即先可排除[A] challenges economists and politicians 挑战经济学家和政治家，和[C] demands priority from the government 要求政府重视；依据第一段的倒数第二句because building new educational systems there and putting enough people through them to improve economic performance would require two or three generations（通过教育体系来使足够多的人能提高经济能力将需要两三代人），由此可知建立教育体系在当前是不可能，而这种建立需要几代人的努力才能实现，故[B] takes efforts of generations 需要几代人的努力是正确的；[D] requires sufficient labor force 需要充足的劳动力第一段没有提及。
33. 【答案】[B] 
【解析】事实细节题。意为：日本和美国劳动力的主要区别是什么。
解答本题可用运排除法。依据文章的第二段，美国劳动力受教育程度差遭到嘲笑并被认为是其经济表现差的原因之一。美国工人接受了职业培训后，本田、丰田的美国公司才达到了日本 95 ％的产量，由此可知日本工人的生产力比美国工人的生产力高。从文中可知，美国劳动力受教育程度差是个事实也是美国经济表现差的重要原因，由此可排除不符合文意的 [C] the U.S workforce has a better education 美国工人教育程度高；而[A] the Japanese workforce is better disciplined 日本工人纪律更严 [D] the U.S workforce is more organized 美国工人组织较好在文中未提及；由此可得出只有[B] the Japanese workforce is more productive日本的劳动力更多产正确，而依据文意，既然日本保持了汽车产量的全球领先地位，自然日本的劳动力比美国的劳力更多产也验证了[B]为正确答案。
34. 【答案】[C] 
【解析】推理判断题。意为：作者引用了我们祖先的例子来表明教育出现在
本题有很大的迷惑性。很多考生选择了[A] when people had enough time 当人们有了充裕的时间时，因为最后一句话明确指出：只有当人们有了更高产的获得食物的方式时，人们才有时间做其它事情。但是本选项只是表面现象，而没有指出教育产生的实质。依据文章倒数第二段的最后两句可知，作者举出了我们祖先的例子是来论证本段第二和第三句话的内容We have begun to suspect that continuing economic growth promotes the development of education even when governments don’t force it. After all, that’s howeducation got started（我们不得不相信，持续的经济发展可以促进教育的发展，即使政府不施加压力。毕竟，这才是教育开始的方式），即教育与经济发展的真正关系：持续的经济发展可以促进教育的发展。因此我们选择[C] when people no longer went hungry在解决了温饱的情况下才可以谈教育。虽然例子中谈到了时间，但没有时间是什么造成的呢？是需要花时间去找猎物来填饱肚子而没了受教育的时间，只有是否饿肚子和经济发展逻辑上相关。[B] prior to better ways of finding food 找到更好的获得食物的方法之前 [D] as a result of pressure on government 由于政府的压力文中没有提及。
35. 【答案】[C] 
【解析】主旨大意题。意为：根据文章的最后一段我们可以得知，教育的发展
解析：文章在最后一段针对上文讨论的教育和生产的关系做出了总结。在本段作者明确指出缺乏正规的教育并不能限制发展极大提高产量的世界劳动力，而反之，对提高产量的限制得以解释了为什么教育发展得没有那么快。由此可见，提高产量优先于发展教育，故[C] follows improved productivity 紧随生产力的提高为正确答案；而[A] results directly from competitive environments 直接源于竞争性环境 [D] cannot afford political changes 无法负担政治变化表达不符合文章的中心；[B] does not depend on economic performance 不取决于经济绩效意思和文意相反。

Text 4
摘自1989年出版的Intellectual Life in America: A History（《美国知识生活的历史》）一书，是一篇关于美国早期历史的文章，讲述美国历史中的清教徒传统，及早期移民的复杂动机和背景。
参考译文：
新大陆历史上被研究最彻底的知识分子就是17世纪新英格兰的牧师和政治领袖。美国哲学的权威历史表明，在殖民时期的美洲，没有一个地方像新英格兰那样“重视知识的追求”。按照很多书和文章的说法，新英格兰的领袖们确立了美国知识分子生活中的基本主题和当务之急，那就是不断演变占支配地位的清教传统。
采用这个方式了解新英格兰通常意味着首先考察清教徒的神学改革和关于教会的独特思想――这也是我们不能忽视的重要话题。但是与对南方知识分子生活的考察相一致，我们可以把最初的清教徒看作是欧洲文化的载体，这种文化逐渐适应了新大陆的环境。新英格兰殖民地是追求广泛理解的理想诸如文明礼貌和艺术鉴赏力等的重大事件的发生地。
马萨诸塞海湾的早期定居者中包括在英国受到过良好教育和非常有影响的人物。在1629年之后的十年里，除了来到马萨诸塞教会的90个左右的有学问的牧师，还有像约翰温思罗普这样的政治领袖。温思罗普是一个有教养的绅士，还是一个律师，在他来到波士顿之前，曾经是英国皇室的官员。这些人写作并出版了大量的作品。为新大陆和欧洲大陆的读者所阅读，使新英格兰呈现出一派严肃的知识氛围。
然而，我们不应该忘记，大多数新英格兰人并没有受过良好的教育。虽然几乎没有什么工匠或农民，更不要说受赡养者和仆人，留下文学作品后人分析，但是非常明显，他们的观点尚未充分理性化。他们的思维常常包含传统的迷信的性质。有一个叫约翰丹的裁缝，他在17世纪30年代后期移民到新英格兰，留下了一份描述自己离开英国的原因的作品，里面充满了许多符号。性别混乱、经济挫折和宗教希望C在他打开圣经的决定性时刻都一起涌来，他告诉父亲他看到的第一行将决定他的命运，他独到了那些不可思议的文字：“你们务要从他们中间出来，不要沾不洁净的物，我要做你们的父，你们要做我的儿女。”人们不仅会想，丹对这些他在清教教堂里所听到的解释圣经的布道会有什么想法呢。
同时，很多的定居者不像丹那样对宗教那样虔诚。有个牧师对此深有感触。在海岸附近，他遇到一些人，这些人对他嘲弄说，他们不是由于宗教才来到新大陆的。“我们的主要目的是捕鱼。”

36. 【答案】[B] 
【解析】事实细节题目。意为：作者认为在 17 世纪的新英格兰
第一段主要是讲17世纪的新英格兰重视知识追求，新英格兰的领袖们确立了美国知识生活中清教传统的基本主题和当务之急。从第一段的第二句话nowhere else in colonial America was “so much importance attached to intellectual pursuits”（没有一个地方像新英格兰那样“重视知识的追求”），可以断定[B] intellectual interests were encouraged 知识兴趣受到鼓励是正确选项；[A] Puritan tradition dominated political life 清教传统支配着政治生活是对原文New England’s leaders established the basic themes and preoccupations of an unfolding, dominant Puritan tradition in American intellectual life（新英格兰的领袖们确立了美国知识分子生活中的基本主题和当务之急，那就是不断演变占支配地位的清教传统）的篡改；[C] Politics benefited much from intellectual endeavors 政治从知识努力中获益非浅从原文的表述中无法推出；[D] intellectual pursuits enjoyed a liberal environment 知识追求享有自由环境文章中没有提到“对于知识的追求享有自由的环境”。
37. 【答案】[B] 
【解析】推理判断题。意为：第二段中暗示出新英格兰人
第二段中的第二句提到，But in keeping with our examination of southern intellectual life, we may consider the original Puritans as carriers of European culture, adjusting to New World circumstances（但是与对南方知识分子生活的考察相一致，我们可以把最初的清教徒看作是欧洲文化的载体，这种文化逐渐适应了新大陆的环境）。由 we may consider the original Puritans as carriers of European culture我们可以断定 [B] brought with them the culture of the Old World带来了旧大陆的文化是正确的选项；选项中的 New Englanders 对应文中的 Puritans, brought with them the culture of the Old World 对应该文章中的 carriers of European culture，故此选项为此句中的同义替换；[A] experienced a comparatively peaceful early history 经历了一个相对和平的早期历史文中没有提及；[C] paid little attention to southern intellectual life 不注重南方知识生活与文中in keeping with our examination of southern intellectual life（与对南方知识分子生活的考察相一致）意思相反；[D] were obsessed with religious innovations 对宗教革新着迷表述与第二段第一句话的意思有出入。
38. 【答案】[D] 
【解析】事实细节题。意为：早期到达马萨诸赛海湾的牧师和政治领袖
根据文章第三段最后一句话These men wrote and published extensively, reaching both New World and Old World audiences, and giving New England an atmosphere of intellectual earnestness（这些人写作并出版了大量的作品。为新大陆和欧洲大陆的读者所阅读，使新英格兰呈现出一派严肃的知识氛围）。与[D] created a new intellectual atmosphere in New England 在新英格兰创造了新的知识氛围相呼应，为正确选项。[A] were famous in the New World for their writings 在新大陆因他们的作品而出名选项中 in the new world 缩小了原文所表述的范围，是对最后一句话的片面理解；[B] gained increasing importance in religious affairs 在宗教事务中赢得了越来越大的重要性文中没有提及；[C] abandoned high positions before coming to the New World 来新大陆之前放弃了很高的地位这只是Winthrop的例子，不能概括所有的早期牧师和政治领袖。
39. 【答案】[A] 
【解析】例证题。意为：关于 John Dane 的故事表明受教育较少的新英格兰人
文章第四段第三句话their thinking often had a traditional superstitions quality（他们的思维常常包含传统迷信的性质），接下来就举了约翰丹的例子。很显然，据这个例子是为了说明第三句话的观点，因此[A] influenced by superstitions 受迷信的影响是正确的。[B] troubled with religious beliefs 受到宗教信仰的困扰 [C] puzzled by church sermons 对教堂布道感到困惑在约翰丹的例子中有所涉及，但不是举例的目的；[D] frustrated with family earnings 对家庭收入感到失望文中没有提及。
40. 【答案】[C] 
【解析】推断题。意为：从文章中可以看出到新英格兰的早期的定居者
通过全文可看出来到英语兰早期的定居者，有政客、牧师、裁缝还有渔民，由此可见早期的定居者背景多种多样，[C] came from different backgrounds 来自不同的背景表述的正是这个意思，为正确选项。[A] were mostly engaged in political activities 主要从事政治活动表述片面；[B] were motivated by an illusory prospect 为虚幻的前景所驱动文中没有提及；[D] left few formal records for later reference 几乎没有留下可供后人参考的正式记录与文中表述有出入。

Part B 
本篇文章出自MSN网站上的百科全书encarta上的文章，主要讲述了人类文化，以及人类认知自身文化的历史进程。本文是一篇文化类的文章，主要讲的是文化发展过程中的各种关于文化的理论。第一段讲的是 Herbert Spencer 的“生物和文化进化理论”。第二段讲的是 Lewis Henry Morgan 的“文化进化理论”。第三段可以看到， Franz Boas 提出了一种“历史特殊论”，它强调所有文化的唯一性。第四段还是讲了 Franz Boas 的理论。第五段我们除了看到“历史特殊论”外，还看到一种“扩散”理论和“扩散主义者”。第六段， émile Durkheim 提出了一种文化理论，他认为宗教信仰有助于加强社会团结。
参考译文：
19世纪60年代英国博物学家查尔斯?达尔文提出开创性的生物进化理论，无独有偶，英国社会哲学家赫尔伯特?斯宾塞提出了自己的生物和文化进化理论。斯宾塞认为，世间所有的现象，包括人类社会，随着时间的变化而变化，朝着完美而发展。他认为，人类进化以他称之为“适者生存”的斗争为特征。在这些斗争中，弱小的种族和社会最终必将为更强大、更先进的种族和社会所代替。
19世纪晚期，美国社会科学家刘易斯?亨利?摩根提出了文化进化的另一理论。摩根与泰勒都是现代人类学的奠基人之一。在其作品中，他企图向人们揭示在社会进化的过程中文化的所有方面是如何共同变化的。因此，摩根认为，诸如家庭结构、婚姻形式，亲属种类、财产所有、政府形式、技术以及食物生产制度等文化的不同方面，都随社会的演变而变化。
20世纪早期，在北美洲，生于德国的美国人类学家弗朗兹?博厄斯发展了一个全新的文化理论，称为“历史特殊论”。历史特殊论强调所有文化的独特性，为人类学的发展提供了新的方向。另外的人类学家认为，像发明这样的文化革新都有一个起源，从一个社会传到另一个社会。这个理论称为“扩散论”。
博厄斯认为，任何社会的文化都必须理解为其独特历史的结果，而不是属于更广泛的进化阶段或者文化类型中诸多文化中的一个。为了尽可能彻底地研究具体的不同文化，博厄斯精通语言学即对语言的研究和体质人类学即对人类生物学和解剖学的研究。
主要是由于博厄斯诸多学生的影响，历史特殊论在美国的人类学研究中成为文化研究的一个重要方法。但20世纪早期的人类学家中也有许多人抵制文化特殊理论，而支持文化扩散理论。有些人把几乎每一个重要的文化进步都归因于少数几个尤其是几个天才民族的发明。按照扩散理论者的观点，这些民族然后再传播到其他文化。比如，基于不充分的信息，英国人类学家格拉弗顿?艾略特和W.J.佩里错误地认为，农业耕作、陶器制作和冶金术都起源于古埃及，然后传播到世界各地。事实上，所有这些文化都是在世界上的不同地方不同时间分别发展起来的。
法国社会学家埃米尔?迪尔海姆也是在20世纪早期发展了一个将对人类学产生深远影响的文化理论。迪尔海姆提出，宗教信仰的作用就是加强社会的团结。对社会功能与文化之间关系的兴趣―称为文化功能主义―成为欧洲特别是英国人类学的一个重要主题。

选项译文：
A.另外的人类学家认为，像发明这样的文化革新都有一个起源，从一个社会传到另一个社会。这个理论称为“扩散论”。
B.为了尽可能彻底地研究具体的不同文化，博厄斯精通语言学即对语言的研究和体质人类学即对人类生物学和解剖学的研究。
C. 他认为，人类进化以他称之为“适者生存”的斗争为特征。在这些斗争中，弱小的种族和社会最终必将为更强大、更先进的种族和社会所代替。
D.他们还重视那些重要似乎能保持一个民族的社会结构的仪式，比如正式象征孩子进入成年的成年礼。
E．因此，摩根认为，诸如家庭结构、婚姻形式，亲属种类、财产所有、政府形式、技术以及食物生产制度等文化的不同方面，都随社会的演变而变化。
F．该理论的支持者把文化看作是共同作用保持社会运转的综合部分的集合。
G．比如，基于不充分的信息，英国人类学家格拉弗顿?艾略特和W.J.佩里错误地认为，农业耕作、陶器制作和冶金术都起源于古埃及，然后传播到世界各地。事实上，所有这些文化都是在世界上的不同地方不同时间分别发展起来的。

41. 【答案】[C] 
【解析】这个空出现在第一段的末尾，而第一段讲的是 Herbert Spencer 的theory of biological and cultural evolution（生物和文化进化理论），并且提到了 Charles Darwin，Coinciding with the groundbreaking theory of biological evolution proposed by British naturalist Charles Darwin in the 1860s（与19世纪60年代英国博物学家查尔斯?达尔文提出开创性的生物进化理论相一致）。我们都知道 Charles Darwin 提出了著名的生物界的适者生存的发展规律。选项 [C] 的意思是，“他认为，人类进化以他称之为‘适者生存’的斗争为特征。在这些斗争中，弱小的种族和社会最终必将为更强大、更先进的种族和社会所代替。”选项[C]说人类社会的进化也有适者生存这一特征，与前面Charles Darwin的适者生存相呼应。空前的那句话说Spencer认为包括人类社会的所有世间现象都是朝着完美的方向在不断变化，加上前面所说的Spencer的生物和文化进化理论与达尔文的生物进化理论相一致，可以确定本题的答案是选项 [C]，其中He argued中的He 显然是指Spencer 。
42. 【答案】[E] 
【解析】本题出现在第二段末，肯定意思应该与本段的意思紧密相连。第二段主要讲的是 Lewis Henry Morgan 的theory of cultural evolution （文化进化理论），空前的那句话说，在他的作品里，他尽量说明了 how aspects of culture changed together in the evolution of societies. （文化的诸多方面随社会的演变而变化）。这跟选项 [E] Thus, in his view, diverse aspects of culture, such as the structure of families, forms of marriage, categories of kinship, ownership of property, forms of government, technology, and systems of food production, all changed as societies evolved（因此，他认为，诸如家庭结构、婚姻形式，亲属种类、财产所有、政府形式、技术以及食物生产制度等文化的不同方面，都随社会的演变而变化）的内容不谋而合。所以，我们可以断定，本题的答案为选项[E]。
43. 【答案】[A] 
【解析】这一题判断起来相对较难。第三段主要介绍了美国人类学家Franz Boas 提出的historical particularism （历史特殊论），强调所有文化的独特性，为人类学的发展提供了新的方向。我们可以推测，最后一句话有可能会是对历史特殊论的进一步解释，或者Boas的其他观点。所以选项[B]有很大的迷惑性；但是，通过对下文的阅读，特别是通过第五段的阅读，我们发现，第五段中将historical particularism和diffusionism（扩散主义）进行了比较，指出历史特殊论之所以流行很大程度上是由于Boas诸多学生的影响；然而也有一些人类学家拒绝历史特殊论而对扩散论情有独钟。而在此之前，没有地方提到过扩散主义，以及这一理论是由谁提出的。所以我们可以推测，第三段有可能是介绍人类学的historical particularism 和，填空的地方就可能是对另一种新观点即diffusionism的介绍。选项[A] 刚好介绍了什么叫diffusionism ，Other anthropologists believed thatcultural innovations, such as inventions, had a single origin and passed from society to society. This theory was known as diffusionism（另外的人类学家认为，像发明这样的文化革新都有一个起源，从一个社会传到另一个社会。这个理论称为扩散论）, 而且other anthropologists 与前文North America, German-born American anthropologist Franz Boas相呼应。由此可以断定，本题正确选项为[A]. 
44. 【答案】[B] 
【解析】第四段继续介绍Franz Boas理论，他认为，任何社会的文化都必须理解为其独特历史的结果，而不是属于更广泛的进化阶段或者文化类型中诸多文化中的一个。很显然，本段是对historical particularism进一步阐述。选项[B] In order to study particular cultures as completely as possible, Boas became skilled in linguistics, the study of languages, and in physical anthropology, the study of human biology and anatomy.（为了尽可能彻底地研究具体的不同文化，博厄斯精通语言学即对语言的研究和体质人类学即对人类生物学和解剖学的研究。），里面既提到Boas，又提到了解特殊的文化（particular cultures 是关键词），符合本段的意思。因此，本题正确选项为[B]。
45. 【答案】[G] 
【解析】第五段对“历史特殊论”和“扩散理论”进行了比较说明，指出“历史特殊论”方法的盛行是由于Boas学生的影响，而“扩散理论”认为，重要的文化进步归因于少数几个天才民族的发明，而这些民族然后再传播到其他文化。选项 [G] For example, British anthropologists Grafton Elliot Smith and W. J. Perry incorrectly suggested, on the basis of inadequate information, that farming, pottery making, and metallurgy all originated in ancient Egypt and diffused throughout the world. In fact, all of these cultural developments occurred separately at different times in many parts of the world. （比如，基于不充分的信息，英国人类学家格拉弗顿?艾略特和W.J.佩里错误地认为，农业耕作、陶器制作和冶金术都起源于古埃及，然后传播到世界各地。事实上，所有这些文化都是在世界上的不同地方不同时间分别发展起来的。）很显然，这是一个例子，通过分析这个例子，我们可以知道，这是两种不同的观点的比较。显然是用来补充说明前面的观点的，即“历史特殊论（historical particularism）”和“扩散理论（diffusionism）理论的对比。所以，本题的答案就是选项[G]。

Part C 
本篇文章节选自John Dewey的专著Democracy and Education（《民主与教育》），是一篇典型的学术论说型文体，讨论的是正规教育的地位。文章首先指出从与他人共处中获得的教育和对年轻人进行的有意教育之间存在显著差异；进而指出，在对待年轻人的问题上，交往本身正在变得越来越重要；最后指出，在不发达的社会群体中几乎没有正规教育和培训，他们主要通过人与人之间的交往来向年轻人灌输需要的性格。
本篇文章节选自John Dewey的专著Democracy and Education（《民主与教育》），是一篇典型的学术论说型文体，讨论的是The Place of Formal Education.（正规教育的地位）。

参考译文：
从与他人共处中获得的教育和对年轻人进行的有意教育之间存在显著差异。在前一种情况，加以是偶然发生的；这种教育是自然的也是重要的，但不是这种关系的直接原因。46、可以说，任何社会制度的价值在于它对扩大和改进经验方面的影响，但是这种影响并不是它原来的动机的一部分。比如，宗教交往始于得到反对势力支持的愿望和避开邪恶势力的愿望；家庭生活始于满足食欲和保护家庭永久的愿望；系统劳动，很大程度上是由于被他人奴役，等等。47、一种制度的副产品，只是逐步被注意到的，而这种效果被视为实施这种制度的一个指导性因素更加缓慢。即使今天，在我们的工业社会中，除勤恳和节俭等价值外，对使工作得以进行的人类交往形式的理性和情感的反应，与物质输出比较起来几乎没有得到人们的关注。
但是，在对待年轻人的问题上，作为人类直接事实的交往本身，越来越重要。48、尽管我们在与年轻人交往时，很容易忽视我们的行为对他们性格的影响，但是与成年人接触或交往却并不那么容易。培训的需要显而易见；实现改变他们态度和习惯的压力十分紧迫，不能完全不顾及这些后果。49、既然我们的主要任务在于使年轻人参与共同生活，我们禁不住考虑我们是否在形成获得这种能力的力量。假如人类在意识到每一个制度的最终价值在于它的特殊的人类影响方面取得了某些进步，我们有充分的理由可以相信，我们主要是通过与年轻人的交往而学到这一点的。
50、因此，我们可以在上面所考虑的广阔的教育过程之内区别出一种比较正规的教育，即直接的教导或学校教育。我们发现，在不发达的社会群体中几乎没有正规教育和培训。这些群体主要依赖于使成年人对他们的群体保持忠诚的相同交往来向年轻人灌输需要的性格。

46. It may be said that the measure of the worth of any social institution is its effect in enlarging and improving experience; but this effect is not a part of its original motive. 
【本句考点】宾语从句， of 短语作定语，代词指代， but 引导并列句。
【结构分析】本句的主干是： It may be said that…, but this effect…；动词said后跟有一个由that引导的宾语从句，宾语从句中的主语是the measure of the worth of any social institution，其中的of 短语作定语，修饰the measure，意为“任何社会制度的价值尺度”；在短语its effect 及 its original motive 中，it 在句中指代 social institution。
【参考译文】可以说，任何社会制度的价值在于它对扩大和改进经验方面的影响，但是这种影响并不是它原来的动机的一部分。
47. Only gradually was the by-product of the institution noted, and only more gradually still was this effect considered as a directive factor in the conduct of the institution.  
【本句考点】强调句的倒装结构。
【结构分析】这是一个由and连接的一个并列句，其中每一个分句都是only短语作状语放句首采用部分倒装的结构：助动词was被提前。正常语序应该是：The by-product of the institution was noted only gradually, and this effect was only still more gradually considered as a directive factor in the conduct of the institution. 其中，directive factor指导性因素，in the conduct of the institution是介词短语做状语，修饰factor，意为“实施这种制度时的指导性因素”。
【参考译文】一种制度的副产品，只是逐步被注意到的，而这种效果被视为实施这种制度的一个指导性因素更加缓慢。
48.While it is easy to ignore in our contact with them the effect of our acts upon their disposition, it is not so easy as in dealing with adults. 
【本句考点】比较状语从句，动宾分隔。
【结构分析】本句主干是 while 引导的一个让步状语从句，其中动词ignore 的宾语是the effect of our acts upon their disposition ，即“忽视了我们的行为对他们的性格的影响”；in our contact with 作为一个插入成分，分隔了 ignore 和它的宾语 the effect of…。
【参考译文】在和他们接触的时候，虽然容易忽略我们的行动对他们的倾向的影响，但是也不像与成年人打交道那么简单。
49.Since our chief business with them is to enable them to share in a common life we cannot help considering whether or not we are forming the powers which will secure this ability. 
【本句考点】 since 引导的原因状语从句，代词指代，宾语从句，宾语从句嵌套定语从句。
【结构分析】本句主干是 Since… we cannot help considering…，其中 whether or not we are forming the powers which will secure this ability（我们是否在形成获得这种能力的力量）作 cannot help considering（不禁）的宾语， which will secure this ability 作为嵌套定语从句修饰 the powers；两个代词them指代的是年轻人。
【参考译文】既然我们的主要任务在于使年轻人参与共同生活，我们禁不住考虑我们是否在形成获得这种能力的力量。
50.We are thus led to distinguish, within the broad educational process which we have been so far considering, a more formal kind of education -- that of direct tuition or schooling. 
【本句考点】插入语，定语从句，同位语
【结构分析】本句主干是： We are thus led to distinguish a more formal kind of education.（因此我们被引导去区分一个更加正规的教育）。破折号后面的that of direct tuition or schooling（直接的教导或学校教育的教育）与 a more formal kind of education（一种更加正规的教育）是同位语关系，是对a more formal kind of education进一步解释。这句话中间插入了within the broad educational process which we have been so far considering （在目前为止一直在思考的广泛的教育过程的范围内），作为插入语，其中which we have been so far considering为定语从句修饰 process。
【参考译文】因此，我们可以在上面所考虑的广阔的教育过程之内区别出一种比较正规的教育，即直接的教导或学校教育。

 Dear editor，
    I have been reading your newspaper for many years and now I am writing this letter to inform you of the pressing situation we are facing now.  
Accustomed to using plastic bags in daily life, some people still take the “white pollution” for granted, which will greatly worsen our environment. As we know, limiting the use of disposable plastic bags is of utmost significance. Therefore, to save the situation from further aggravating, I would like to give the following suggestions: 
First and foremost, groups and individuals who are polluting our environment by using the disposable plastic bags should be severely punished. In addition, the local media can make full use of their own influence to publicize the negative effect of plastic bags and enhance people’s awareness of environmental protection. Last but not least, new technologies should be developed to find possible alternatives with degradable and renewable materials. 
I hope that my suggestions are helpful and your prompt attention to my suggestions would be highly appreciated.

您好！
好多年来，我一直阅读贵报。我写这封信的目的是要告诉您我们所面临的紧迫形势。
有些人已经习惯了在日常生活中使用塑料袋，习惯了会使环境恶化的“白色污染”。我们都知道，限制使用一次性塑料袋意义重大。因此，为了阻止形式进一步恶化，提出以下几条建议：
首先，严厉惩罚那些使用一次性塑料袋而污染环境的个人和团体。其次，地方媒体充分利用自己的影响来宣传塑料袋的副作用，从而提高人们的环境保护意识。最后但也是最重要的，利用新技术开发可降解可再生的可能的替代品。
希望这些建议对您有帮助，也感谢您对这些建议的关注。

构思与评析：
本题要求写一封建议信，要求比较具体，话题也比较熟悉，可写的东西比较多。因此这篇小作文题材是大家非常熟悉的，难度适中。
一般说来，建议信多属于半开放性作文，要求根据所给材料给出有针对性的解决办法或提出合理化的建议。要符合英语书信的基本格式要求。
由所给的提纲来看，信的内容应该先对不成功的塑料袋禁止发表自己的看法，然后给出2-3条建议，因此这是一封重在建议的信。范文中第一段首先简要说明写信的原因。第二段则提出当前面临的形势，某些地方塑料袋禁止不成功，白色污染仍然存在，危害周围环境；鉴于这种情况，特提出建议。第三段则具体说明提出的三条建议：惩罚塑料袋使用者；发挥媒体作用，宣传塑料袋的危害，提高环境保护意识；研发新的替代品。第四段希望自己的信得到重视。
本文紧扣主题，包含了要求的所有内容，提出了合理的建议，使用了一些不错的词组和句子。格式规范，逻辑性较强，条理清晰，是篇不错的作文。

书信格式及常用句型：
考研小作文的书信在格式上比较简单，一般不要求写信头或信内地址，直接从称呼开始，一般以Dear …开始，接下来就是信的重要内容了。应该注意的是在书写正文时，开头一般要写明写信的原因，结尾处要有结束语，然后是签名。签名一般用Yours faithfully,Yours sincerely, Yours,等。熟人朋友之间也可以用Love,Yoursever，等。
1. I am much pleased to inform you that……. 非常高兴告诉你……

    As we can see in the picture, many people, old or young, men or women, are in front of a computer and using the Internet in the space just like a huge web of a spider. The caption in the drawing reads: “the Internet: near or far ”. 
It is obvious that the huge spider web is the symbol of the Internet and the symbolic meaning of the picture is the effect of the Internet 
on people’s way of life. There is no doubt that the 
Internet provides us with considerable convenience. Internet is revolutionizing our way of living, making many things possible which are beyond our dreams. As a communication tool, the Internet makes us closer than ever before by providing immediate communication via e-mail, QQ, MSN or 
ICQ, no matter how far away our friends are. So in this sense, the Internet is making us nearer to each other. 
  However, there are negative effects of the Internet on people’s life. 
As is shown in the picture, people are imprisoned in their own respective small cabins, indulging in their own world. They choose contacting online rather than communicating face to face. Due to the addiction to the fictional world, people seem to have forgotten the traditional and most efficient communication method, and thus indifference has become a not uncommon phenomenon in the modern world. We often hear parents complain that they have less and less time chatting with their children either because their children spend too much time playing games or chatting online with friends or 
strangers. Also there are couples who seldom talk with each other. Therefore, Internet seems to make near people far away. 
  Hence, how to use modern communication tools such as Internet properly has becomes a hot issue in recent years. While we are enjoying the convenience provided by the Internet, we should also bear in mind that human beings are social beings who need real interpersonal interactions. 
Joint efforts are needed to ensure enough time for people especially families to have face-to-face 
communication with each other. Only in this way can we expect a healthy development of the 
relationship among individuals.    

构思与评析：
大作文仍然是图画式作文。写好这篇作文主要在于两点：第一，描述图画。图片描写可能会给一部分考生造成困难，这一点要看学生平时的积累。第二，寓意理解。题目图片看似简单，实则抽象。揭示主题需结合中文提示“网络的近与远”，即网络为人们的生活带来的便利以及不便。这一主题比较贴近现代生活，也是当今大学生熟悉的话题：网络虽然非常便利，让人与人足不出户就可以相互联系，但是人与人之间的直接联系却变得稀少了。据此，可以列出如下提纲：第一段对所给图画进行描述，许多人在蜘蛛网一样的各自的空间里上网，下面是说明文字：“网络的近与远”。第二、三段对图画的含义进行说明：一方面，网络作为交际手段给我们带来了很大的方便，在这个意义上，网络使人与人的距离拉近了；另一方面，人们过多地沉迷于网络，致使朋友、家人之间面对面的交流变少，在这个意义上，网络使人与人的距离更远。第四段说明自己的观点：应该避免网络的负面影响，加强人与人面对面的交流。本文从图片的描述入手，明确提出了图画的含义，并多网络的近与远进行了辩证说明，分析透彻，说理充分，是篇难道的佳作。
译文：从图中我们可以看到，很多包括年青人和老年人的男男女女正坐在电脑前面，在像一张大蜘蛛网一样的空间内上网。下面是一行说明文字：“网络的近与远”。很显然，这张大蛛网就是互联网的象征，这幅图的象征意义就是互联网对人们生活方式的影响。毫无疑问，互联网给我们提供了很多的方便。互联网正在改变我们的生活方式，使得以前做梦都不敢想的许多事情成为可能。作为一个通讯工具，互联网通过电子邮件、
QQ，MSN或ICQ，给我们提供了即时通讯，不管我们离得有多远，从而，大大缩短了人们之间的距离。因此，在这个意义上，互联网正在是我们更加接近。然而，互联网也给人们的生活带来了负面影响。正如图中所示，人们被囚禁在各自的空间里，沉溺在网络中。不是进行面对面的沟通，他们选择在线交流。由于沉溺于虚构的世界，人们似乎已经忘记了传统的最有效的沟通方式，因此，先到社会中互相漠不关心已经成为一个常见的现象。我们会经常听到父母抱怨与孩子们聊天的时间越来越少，因为他们把过多的时间用来玩游戏或者在网上通朋友或陌生人聊天。此外，还有一些夫妇，彼此很少交谈。所以，互联网似乎在使离得很近的人们之间更加遥远。因此，如何正确使用像互联网这样的现代通讯工具成为近年来的一个热门话题。我们在享用互联网提供的方便之时，一定要牢记，人类是需要真实的人际交流的社会动物。我们应该共同努力，确保人们之间特别是家人之间面对面的沟通。只有这样，我们才能够有望建立人与人之间关系的健康发展。

The idea that some groups of people may be more intelligent than others is one of those hypotheses that dare not speak its name. But Gregory Cochran is 大1家 to say it anyway. He is that 大2家 bird, a scientist who works independently 大3家 any institution. He helped popularize the idea that some diseases not 大4家 thought to have a bacterial cause were actually infections, which aroused much controversy when it was first suggested.

They also suffer more often than most people from a number of nasty genetic diseases, such as breast cancer. These facts, 大14家, have previously been thought unrelated. The former has been 大15家 to social effects, such as a strong tradition of 大16家 education. The latter was seen as a (an) 大17家 of genetic isolation. Dr. Cochran suggests that the intelligence and diseases are intimately 大18家. His argument is that the unusual history of these people has 大19家 them to unique evolutionary pressures that have resulted in this 大20家 state of affairs.

While still catching up to men in some spheres of modern life, women appear to be way ahead in at least one undesirable category. “Women are particularly susceptible to developing depression and anxiety disorders in response to stress compared to men,” according to Dr. Yehuda, chief psychiatrist at New York’s Veteran’s Administration Hospital.
Studies of both animals and humans have shown that sex hormones somehow affect the stress response, causing females under stress to produce more of the trigger chemicals than do males under the same conditions. In several of the studies, when stressed-out female rats had their ovaries (the female reproductive organs) removed, their chemical responses became equal to those of the males.
Adding to a woman’s increased dose of stress chemicals, are her increased “opportunities” for stress. “It’s not necessarily that women don’t cope as well. It’s just that they have so much more to cope with,” says Dr. Yehuda. “Their capacity for tolerating stress may even be greater than men’s,” she observes, “it’s just that they’re dealing with so many more things that they become worn out from it more visibly and sooner.”
Dr. Yehuda notes another difference between the sexes. “I think that the kinds of things that women are exposed to tend to be in more of a chronic or repeated nature. Men go to war and are exposed to combat stress. Men are exposed to more acts of random physical violence. The kinds of interpersonal violence that women are exposed to tend to be in domestic situations, by, unfortunately, parents or other family members, and they tend not to be one-shot deals. The wear-and-tear that comes from these longer relationships can be quite devastating.”
Adeline Alvarez married at 18 and gave birth to a son, but was determined to finish college. “I struggled a lot to get the college degree. I was living in so much frustration that that was my escape, to go to school, and get ahead and do better.” Later, her marriage ended and she became a single mother. “It’s the hardest thing to take care of a teenager, have a job, pay the rent, pay the car payment, and pay the debt. I lived from paycheck to paycheck.”
Not everyone experiences the kinds of severe chronic stresses Alvarez describes. But most women today are coping with a lot of obligations, with few breaks, and feeling the strain. Alvarez’s experience demonstrates the importance of finding ways to diffuse stress before it threatens your health and your ability to function.

[A] Women are biologically more vulnerable to stress.
[B] Women are still suffering much stress caused by men.

[A] need extra doses of chemicals to handle stress.
[B] have limited capacity for tolerating stress.
[C] are more capable of avoiding stress.
[D] are exposed to more stress.
23.	According to Paragraph 4, the stress women confront tends to be
[A] domestic and temporary.
[B] irregular and violent.
[C] durable and frequent.
[D] trivial and random.
24.	The sentence “I lived from paycheck to paycheck.” (Line 6, Para. 5) shows that
[A] Alvarez cared about nothing but making money.
[B] Alvarez’s salary barely covered her household expenses.
[C] Alvarez got paychecks from different jobs.

It used to be so straightforward. A team of researchers working together in the laboratory would submit the results of their research to a journal. A journal editor would then remove the authors’ names and affiliations from the paper and send it to their peers for review. Depending on the comments received, the editor would accept the paper for publication or decline it. Copyright rested with the journal publisher, and researchers seeking knowledge of the results would have to subscribe to the journal.
No longer. The Internet C and pressure from funding agencies, who are questioning why commercial publishers are making money from government-funded research by restricting access to it C is making access to scientific results a reality. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has just issued a report describing the far-reaching consequences of this. The report, by John Houghton of Victoria University in Australia and Graham Vickery of the OECD, makes heavy reading for publishers who have, so far, made handsome profits. But it goes further than that. It signals a change in what has, until now, been a key element of scientific endeavor.
The value of knowledge and the return on the public investment in research depends, in part, upon wide distribution and ready access. It is big business. In America, the core scientific publishing market is estimated at between $7 billion and $11 billion. The International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers says that there are more than 2,000 publishers worldwide specializing in these subjects. They publish more than 1.2 million articles each year in some 16,000 journals.
This is now changing. According to the OECD report, some 75% of scholarly journals are now online. Entirely new business models are emerging; three main ones were identified by the report’s authors. There is the so-called big deal, where institutional subscribers pay for access to a collection of online journal titles through site-licensing agreements. There is open-access publishing, typically supported by asking the author (or his employer) to pay for the paper to be published. Finally, there are open-access archives, where organizations such as universities or international laboratories support institutional repositories. Other models exist that are hybrids of these three, such as delayed open-access, where journals allow only subscribers to read a paper for the first six months, before making it freely available to everyone who wishes to see it. All this could change the traditional form of the peer-review process, at least for the publication of papers.
26.	In the first paragraph, the author discusses
[A] the background information of journal editing.
[B] the publication routine of laboratory reports.
[C] the relations of authors with journal publishers.
[D] the traditional process of journal publication.
27.	Which of the following is true of the OECD report?
[A] It criticizes government-funded research.
[B] It introduces an effective means of publication.
[C] It upsets profit-making journal publishers.
[D] It benefits scientific research considerably.
28.	According to the text, online publication is significant in that
[A] it provides an easier access to scientific results.
[B] it brings huge profits to scientific researchers.
[C] it emphasizes the crucial role of scientific knowledge.
[D] it facilitates public investment in scientific research.
29.	With the open-access publishing model, the author of a paper is required to
[A] cover the cost of its publication.
[B] subscribe to the journal publishing it.
[C] allow other online journals to use it freely.
[D] complete the peer-review before submission.
30.	Which of the following best summarizes the text?
[A] The Internet is posing a threat to publishers.
[B] A new mode of publication is emerging.
[C] Authors welcome the new channel for publication.
[D] Publication is rendered easier by online service.
Text 3
In the early 1960s Wilt Chamberlain was one of only three players in the National Basketball Association (NBA) listed at over seven feet. If he had played last season, however, he would have been one of 42. The bodies playing major professional sports have changed dramatically over the years, and managers have been more than willing to adjust team uniforms to fit the growing numbers of bigger, longer frames.
The trend in sports, though, may be obscuring an unrecognized reality: Americans have generally stopped growing. Though typically about two inches taller now than 140 years ago, today’s people C especially those born to families who have lived in the U.S. for many generations C apparently reached their limit in the early 1960s. And they aren’t likely to get any taller. “In the general population today, at this genetic, environmental level, we’ve pretty much gone as far as we can go,” says anthropologist William Cameron Chumlea of Wright State University. In the case of NBA players, their increase in height appears to result from the increasingly common practice of recruiting players from all over the world.
Growth, which rarely continues beyond the age of 20, demands calories and nutrients C notably, protein C to feed expanding tissues. At the start of the 20th century, under-nutrition and childhood infections got in the way. But as diet and health improved, children and adolescents have, on average, increased in height by about an inch and a half every 20 years, a pattern known as the secular trend in height. Yet according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, average height C 5′9″ for men, 5′4″ for women C hasn’t really changed since 1960.
Genetically speaking, there are advantages to avoiding substantial height. During childbirth, larger babies have more difficulty passing through the birth canal. Moreover, even though humans have been upright for millions of years, our feet and back continue to struggle with bipedal posture and cannot easily withstand repeated strain imposed by oversize limbs. “There are some real constraints that are set by the genetic architecture of the individual organism,” says anthropologist William Leonard of Northwestern University.
Genetic maximums can change, but don’t expect this to happen soon. Claire C. Gordon, senior anthropologist at the Army Research Center in Natick, Mass., ensures that 90 percent of the uniforms and workstations fit recruits without alteration. She says that, unlike those for basketball, the length of military uniforms has not changed for some time. And if you need to predict human height in the near future to design a piece of equipment, Gordon says that by and large, “you could use today’s data and feel fairly confident.”
31.	Wilt Chamberlain is cited as an example to
[A] illustrate the change of height of NBA players.
[B] show the popularity of NBA players in the U.S..
[C] compare different generations of NBA players.
[D] assess the achievements of famous NBA players.
32.	Which of the following plays a key role in body growth according to the text?
[A] Genetic modification.
[B] Natural environment.
[C] Living standards.
[D] Daily exercise.
33.	On which of the following statements would the author most probably agree?
[A] Non-Americans add to the average height of the nation.
[B] Human height is conditioned by the upright posture.
[C] Americans are the tallest on average in the world.
[D] Larger babies tend to become taller in adulthood.
34.	We learn from the last paragraph that in the near future
[A] the garment industry will reconsider the uniform size.
[B] the design of military uniforms will remain unchanged.
[C] genetic testing will be employed in selecting sportsmen.
[D] the existing data of human height will still be applicable.
35.	The text intends to tell us that
[A] the change of human height follows a cyclic pattern.
[B] human height is becoming even more predictable.
[C] Americans have reached their genetic growth limit.
[D] the genetic pattern of Americans has altered.
Text 4
In 1784, five years before he became president of the United States, George Washington, 52, was nearly toothless. So he hired a dentist to transplant nine teeth into his jaw C having extracted them from the mouths of his slaves.
That’s a far different image from the cherry-tree-chopping George most people remember from their history books. But recently, many historians have begun to focus on the roles slavery played in the lives of the founding generation. They have been spurred in part by DNA evidence made available in 1998, which almost certainly proved Thomas Jefferson had fathered at least one child with his slave Sally Hemings. And only over the past 30 years have scholars examined history from the bottom up. Works of several historians reveal the moral compromises made by the nation’s early leaders and the fragile nature of the country’s infancy. More significantly, they argue that many of the Founding Fathers knew slavery was wrong C and yet most did little to fight it.
More than anything, the historians say, the founders were hampered by the culture of their time. While Washington and Jefferson privately expressed distaste for slavery, they also understood that it was part of the political and economic bedrock of the country they helped to create.
For one thing, the South could not afford to part with its slaves. Owning slaves was “like having a large bank account,” says Wiencek, author of An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America. The southern states would not have signed the Constitution without protections for the “peculiar institution,” including a clause that counted a slave as three fifths of a man for purposes of congressional representation.
And the statesmen’s political lives depended on slavery. The three-fifths formula handed Jefferson his narrow victory in the presidential election of 1800 by inflating the votes of the southern states in the Electoral College. Once in office, Jefferson extended slavery with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803; the new land was carved into 13 states, including three slave states.
Still, Jefferson freed Hemings’s children C though not Hemings herself or his approximately 150 other slaves. Washington, who had begun to believe that all men were created equal after observing the bravery of the black soldiers during the Revolutionary War, overcame the strong opposition of his relatives to grant his slaves their freedom in his will. Only a decade earlier, such an act would have required legislative approval in Virginia.
36.	George Washington’s dental surgery is mentioned to
[A] show the primitive medical practice in the past.
[B] demonstrate the cruelty of slavery in his days.
[C] stress the role of slaves in the U.S. history.
[D] reveal some unknown aspect of his life.
37.	We may infer from the second paragraph that
[A] DNA technology has been widely applied to history research.
[B] in its early days the U.S. was confronted with delicate situations.
[C] historians deliberately made up some stories of Jefferson’s life.
[D] political compromises are easily found throughout the U.S. history.
38.	What do we learn about Thomas Jefferson?
[A] His political view changed his attitude towards slavery.
[B] His status as a father made him free the child slaves.
[C] His attitude towards slavery was complex.
[D] His affair with a slave stained his prestige.
39.	Which of the following is true according to the text?
[A] Some Founding Fathers benefit politically from slavery.
[B] Slaves in the old days did not have the right to vote.
[C] Slave owners usually had large savings accounts.
[D] Slavery was regarded as a peculiar institution.
40.	Washington’s decision to free slaves originated from his
[A] moral considerations.
[B] military experience.
[C] financial conditions.
[D] political stand.

Once you have a first draft on paper, you can delete material that is unrelated to your thesis and add material necessary to illustrate your points and make your paper convincing.

Remember that your initial draft is only that. You should go through the paper many times C and then again C working to substantiate and clarify your ideas. You may even end up with several entire versions of the paper. Rewrite. The sentences within each paragraph should be related to a single topic. Transitions should connect one paragraph to the next so that there are no abrupt or confusing shifts. Awkward or wordy phrasing or unclear sentences and paragraphs should be mercilessly poked and prodded into shape.
[A]	To make revising easier, leave wide margins and extra space between lines so that you can easily add words, sentences, and corrections. Write on only one side of the paper.
[B]	After you have clearly and adequately developed the body of your paper, pay particular attention to the introductory and concluding paragraphs. It’s probably best to write the introduction last, after you know precisely what you are introducing. Concluding paragraphs demand equal attention because they leave the reader with a final impression.
[C]	It’s worth remembering, however, that though a clean copy fresh off a printer may look terrific, it will read only as well as the thinking and writing that have gone into it. Many writers prudently store their data on disks and print their pages each time they finish a draft to avoid losing any material because of power failures or other problems.
[D]	It makes no difference how you write, just so you do. Now that you have developed a topic into a tentative thesis, you can assemble your notes and begin to flesh out whatever outline you have made.
[E]	Although this is an interesting issue, it has nothing to do with the thesis, which explains how the setting influences Sammy’s decision to quit his job. Instead of including that paragraph, she added one that described Lengel’s crabbed response to the girls so that she could lead up to the A & P “policy” he enforces.
[F]	In the final paragraph about the significance of the setting in “A & P,” the student brings together the reasons Sammy quit his job by referring to his refusal to accept Lengel’s store policies.
[G]	By using the first draft as a means of thinking about what you want to say, you will very likely discover more than your notes originally suggested. Plenty of good writers don’t use outlines at all but discover ordering principles as they write. Do not attempt to compose a perfectly correct draft the first time around.

In his autobiography, Darwin himself speaks of his intellectual powers with extraordinary modesty. He points out that he always experienced much difficulty in expressing himself clearly and concisely, but (46) he believes that this very difficulty may have had the compensating advantage of forcing him to think long and intently about every sentence, and thus enabling him to detect errors in reasoning and in his own observations. He disclaimed the possession of any great quickness of apprehension or wit, such as distinguished Huxley. (47) He asserted, also, that his power to follow a long and purely abstract train of thought was very limited, for which reason he felt certain that he never could have succeeded with mathematics. His memory, too, he described as extensive, but hazy. So poor in one sense was it that he never could remember for more than a few days a single date or a line of poetry. (48) On the other hand, he did not accept as well founded the charge made by some of his critics that, while he was a good observer, he had no power of reasoning. This, he thought, could not be true, because the “Origin of Species” is one long argument from the beginning to the end, and has convinced many able men. No one, he submits, could have written it without possessing some power of reasoning. He was willing to assert that “I have a fair share of invention, and of common sense or judgment, such as every fairly successful lawyer or doctor must have, but not, I believe, in any higher degree.” (49) He adds humbly that perhaps he was “superior to the common run of men in noticing things which easily escape attention, and in observing them carefully.”
Writing in the last year of his life, he expressed the opinion that in two or three respects his mind had changed during the preceding twenty or thirty years. Up to the age of thirty or beyond it poetry of many kinds gave him great pleasure. Formerly, too, pictures had given him considerable, and music very great, delight. In 1881, however, he said: “Now for many years I cannot endure to read a line of poetry. I have also almost lost my taste for pictures or music.” (50) Darwin was convinced that the loss of these tastes was not only a loss of happiness, but might possibly be injurious to the intellect, and more probably to the moral character.

Section II Reading Comprehension
Part A
　　Text 1
21. 【答案】[A] 
【解析】题目问的是通过对前两段的了解选出正确选项。通过对原文的了解可知，文章前两段主要描写男女因为生理上的差异，所以可能在相同的情况下，女性可能更容易在压力下产生焦虑和沮丧。B项和C项不符合文意，B项所指的女性遭受压力多来自男性偏离文章线索。C项所说的女性相比男性更有处理压力的经验也是断章取义 。D选项只是单纯描述男女之间在面对压力的差异，与中心偏离。
22. 【答案】[D] 
【解析】Dr.Ychuda 的研究中指出，女性实际上或许更善于容忍压力，是因为面对的压力比男性要多得多，所以才容易在压力面前表现出焦虑。A项意思错误，文章含义是指其因为身体所具备的化学物质而更易焦虑。B选项错在文中第三段第三行所提的女性容忍压力的能力或许比男性要更好。
23.【答案】[C] 
【解析】第四段中指出，女性面临的压力大多来自家庭内部而且时常发生，并非如男性所面临的压力大多是战争和具有偶然性的动态情况中。C选项中的“持久性”和“频繁性” 符合文意。A项意思是“家庭内部的”和“暂时性的”，B项是“不规则型的”和“暴力性的”，D项是“琐碎的”和“偶然的”。
24. 【答案】[B] 
【解析】句子意思是指“我活在不停的支付支票生活中”。从文中我们可以看出，因为是单身母亲，Alvarez面临很大的生存压力，付房租，支付用车花销，偿还贷款等。只有B项中所指的她的薪水几乎不能满足日常生活开销符合文意。
25. 【答案】[D] 
【解析】因为性别上的差异，女性在压力面前的主要表现。A项过于宽泛，离开了文中关于性别之间讨论的中心。C项只是文章中的一个具体知识点，不能概括文章全部内容。B项只是单纯指出了男女在压力面前的差异，但没有注意文章中侧重女性压力前表现的文意。

Text 2
26. 【答案】[B] 
【解析】本题考查的是考生对第一段的理解。根据文章，第一段作者说到，实验室把他们的研究结果递交刊物，刊物的编辑在隐去作者姓名及相关信息后把论文递交给编审，根据审查结果或出版或拒绝出版此篇论文。版权由杂志社保留。研究者必须订阅杂志才能查找此研究结果的相关文章。很明显，此段讲述的是实验室报告的出版程序。选项A刊物编辑的背景信息和选项C作者与出版商的关系及选项D刊物出版的传统流程都未能准确概括本段的含义。
27. 【答案】[C] 
【解析】从文章本题的答案信息来源在文章的第二段。第二段说到，互联网使接触到科学结果成为一个现实。OECD刚刚发布一个报告，描写了其深远的影响。这份报告使到目前为止赢得不菲利润的很多出版商争相阅读(the report make heavy reading for publishers)。第三段说到核心科学出版市场利润巨大，第四段说到，这种情况正在改变，也是在线出版可能让他们利润下滑，所以让他们有些不安，故答案为C。
28. 【答案】[A] 
【解析】从文章结构看，文章第一段重点地介绍了传统的出版方式，这种方式使科学工作者只有订购了该科学杂志才可以获得科学的结果。文章第二段介绍一种新型的出版方式――网络出版，使得科技人员容易获得科学结果。第三段谈到科学的价值和投资回报取决于杂志的发行量和易获得性。第四段具体介绍了这一新趋势的主要出版模式。从文章的中心是关于一种新的出版方式，以及它给科学杂志出版带来的影响――可以更方便的获得科学结果。中心词含有access，反应中心的是解，可以确定答案为A。
29. 【答案】[A] 
【解析】从文中“there is open-access publishing,typically supported by asking the author to pay for the paper to be publish”可知答案为A。
30. 【答案】[B] 
【解析】正于28题分析的，本文中心介绍了一种出版新的趋势――网络出版。B正是这一观点的高度概括，故答案为B.

Text 3
31. 【答案】[A] 
【解析】文中“…listed at over seven feet. If he had ….The bodies.. changed dramatically over the years”可以看出此段主要讲述NBA球员身高的变化;另外，从文章中心来看，可以排出B，C，D。因此选A
32. 【答案】[C] 
【解析】从第三段“but as diet and health improved, children and adolescents have increased in height by…..”可以看出生活水平对于身体成长起着非常重要的作用;另外，A，B，D选项所涉及的genetic modification ,natural environment 和daily exercise文中并没有提到;
33. 【答案】[B] 
【解析】题干中提到“most probably..”，通过排出法，可以确定B为最佳选项。
34. 【答案】[D] 
【解析】最后一段Claire C. Gordon提到90%的制服和工作站仍将会适合新招人员，这就暗示了D选项所提到的内容。另外，可以依据排出法可以知道A，B，C不正确。
35. 【答案】[C] 
【解析】从全文中心来看，文章并不是以“predict human height”为中心的，而是在谈美国人身高问题。所以C选项为正确选项。

Text 4
36. 【答案】[C] 
【解析】 根据文章的逻辑一致性和联系，从第二段的“But recently, many historians have begun to focus on the roles of slavery…..”可以看出作者在第一段举George Washing(第一任美国总统)对待奴隶的例子是为了说明“美国历史上奴隶制的作用”。因此选C
37.【答案】[D] 
【解析】根据排除法A项中的widely是错误的，排除;B项中说的太笼统，而第二段在讲关于slavery. C项中deliberately和made up是不对的。因此选D。
38. 【答案】[C] 
【解析】从文章的内容来看，Jefferson知道奴隶制是错误的，但是他又作出了compromise(妥协)，从此而知，其对待奴隶制的态度是复杂的(complex).
39. 【答案】[A] 
【解析】从最后第二段第二句中可以看出Jefferson能在1800年大选中以微弱优势胜出是得意于其“将努力看作3/5人”，A选项是正确的。
40. 【答案】[B] 
【解析】从最后一段“after observing the bravery of the black soldiers during the Revolutionary War…. ”可以看出Washington做出释放奴隶的决定是在他看见黑人士兵在独立战争中的英勇作战以后，因此B为正确选项。

Part B
41. 【答案】[D] 
【解析】空前面出现的内容告诉读者如果写文章时只要作者不再试图避免一些事情第一稿就会跃然纸上，在空后第一句里出现了outline这个词，因此41题中也会出现和outline相关的内容。D选项的内容就中提到用什么方式来写作不重要，重要的是定下一个题目，然后可以通过整理笔记来填充你的 outline(提纲)。空前面所提到的坐着写、站着写、躺着写说的正是写作的方式。
42．【答案】[G] 
【解析】选项是在讲draft的问题，所以答案中还会涉及到draft。选项后的句子中提到：一些写作中的错误可以等到修改的时候才去处理。选项的最后提到不要尝试在第一次的时候写出完全没有任何错误的文稿，因此G选项符合这个逻辑。
43. 【答案】[A] 
【解析】在选项后面出现了that way 所以上文中会说到具体的哪种方式，只有A选项提到了具体的方式，因此符合题意。
44. 【答案】[C] 
【解析】选项后面提到了these printouts，空前面提到:“在修改过程中，看打印出来的材料比看电脑屏幕容易。”因此44题选项中也会有和打印出来的材料相关的内容。C选项中很明显地有copy 还有 printer对应下文中所提及的打印出来的材料。
45. 【答案】[E] 
【解析】前文提到Sammy这个人，这是一个线索词，选项中E 和F中都包含这个词，但是此段的主题句提到，在写作中要删去与主题不相关的素材，E选项中instead of adding that paragraph，也就意味着删去了这段。和主题句对应。
而F选项只是在说最后一段的具体内容，和本段的主题句不相关，故不符合题意。
Part C
46. He believes that this very difficulty may have had the compensating advantage of forcing him to think long and intently about every sentence, and thus enabling him to detect errors in reasoning and in his own observations.
【解析】本句的考查点是that引导的宾语从句，主干是he believes that….that从句的结构是this very difficulty may have the….advantage of forcing…, and thus enabling…。Of后面forcing和enabling组成的并列结构做advantage的同位语。
【参考译文】达尔文认为正是因为这个困难，促使他对每一个句子进行长时间和针对性的思考，同时也使得他在观察和推理中发现错误。这也就使他具有了别人所不具备的优势。
47. He asserted, also, that his power to follow a long and purely abstract train of thought was very limited, for which reason he felt certain that he never could have succeeded with mathematics.
【解析】本句考查点是宾语从句，非限制性定语从句。主干是He asserted that…。宾语从句的结构是his power to… was…。其中不定式to引导的部分 follow …of thought做power的定语;for which reason所引导的非限制性定语从句中又包含一个that引导的表语从句。
【参考译文】达尔文同时声称，对于冗长而且纯抽象的思想，自己的理解能力并不强。因为这个原因，他相信自己在数学方面根本不会成功。
48. On the other hand, he did not accept as well founded the charge made by some of his critics that, while he was a good observer, he had no power of reasoning.
【解析】本句考查点是同位语从句，让步状语从句。主干是he did not accept… the charge made by… that…。其中as well founded作为一个插入成分，对charge进行修饰。made引导的过去分词短语作定语修饰charge。That引导的从句是charge的同位语，包括一个while引导的让步状语从句。
【参考译文】另一方面，虽然有些批评他的人一致认为他善于观察，但不具备推理能力，但是他不同意这种说法。
49. He adds humbly that perhaps he was “superior to the common run of men in noticing things which easily escape attention, and in observing them carefully.”
【解析】本句考查点是宾语从句，定语从句。主干是he adds …that… 其中宾语从句的结构是he was superior to …in…, and in…。which引导的是things的定语从句。
【参考译文】达尔文很谦虚的补充到，有些事情需要高度的注意力和细心的观察，也许他自己在观察此类事情时比一般人有优势。
50. Darvin was convinced that the loss of these tastes was not only a loss of happiness, but might possibly be injurious to the intellect, and more probably to the moral character.
【解析】本题考查点是宾语从句。主干是Darvin was convinced that…。其中宾语从句的结构是the loss of these tastes was not only…, but…be injurious to …, and to …。
【参考译文】达尔文认为，对(音乐和绘画方面)兴趣的丧失，失去的不仅仅是一种乐趣，而且可能会伤害到智力，更有甚者还可能伤害到道德。

52、大作文范文
As is illustrated in the picture, the two disabled persons whose crippled legs are bound together do a lot of traveling. Accordingly, this far-reaching picture reflects a common phenomenon in today’s society: the people who are in the dark want to turn the corner but they can not make it respectively and in turn they have to choose to pull together in times of trouble.
There are several reasons accounting for this. Since we have to live in an on-the-move lifestyle, we may encounter various plights, where we would be at a loss rather than to seek for others’ assistance. Further more, if we do not offer help to each other when we confront dilemma, we would not realize our dream. And no issue in China is as basic to build up the society in harmony as to conduct coordination in face of disasters.
Judging from what have been argued above, people have come to realize the value of mutual aid. It is, therefore, necessary that some effective steps be made to advocate spirit of supporting each other. To begin with, the government should make laws to encourage people to unite. In addition, people should enhance the awareness of caring each other especially when they are in trouble. Only in those ways, can we make people, even not being acquaintance, help each other.

If you were to examine the birth certificates of every soccer player in 2006’s World Cup tournament, you would most likely find a noteworthy quirk: elite soccer players are more likely to have been born in the earlier months of the year than in the later months. If you then examined the European national youth teams that feed the World Cup and professional ranks, you would find this strange phenomenon to be even more pronounced.
What might account for this strange phenomenon? Here are a few guesses: a) certain astrological signs confer superior soccer skills; b) winter-born babies tend to have higher oxygen capacity, which increases soccer stamina; c) soccer-mad parents are more likely to conceive children in springtime, at the annual peak of soccer mania; d) none of the above.
Anders Ericsson, a 58-year-old psychology professor at Florida State University, says he believes strongly in “none of the above.” Ericsson grew up in Sweden, and studied nuclear engineering until he realized he would have more opportunity to conduct his own research if he switched to psychology. His first experiment, nearly 30 years ago, involved memory: training a person to hear and then repeat a random series of numbers. “With the first subject, after about 20 hours of training, his digit span had risen from 7 to 20,” Ericsson recalls. “He kept improving, and after about 200 hours of training he had risen to over 80 numbers.”
This success, coupled with later research showing that memory itself is not genetically determined, led Ericsson to conclude that the act of memorizing is more of a cognitive exercise than an intuitive one. In other words, whatever inborn differences two people may exhibit in their abilities to memorize, those differences are swamped by how well each person “encodes” the information. And the best way to learn how to encode information meaningfully, Ericsson determined, was a process known as deliberate practice. Deliberate practice entails more than simply repeating a task. Rather, it involves setting specific goals, obtaining immediate feedback and concentrating as much on technique as on outcome.
Ericsson and his colleagues have thus taken to studying expert performers in a wide range of pursuits, including soccer. They gather all the data they can, not just performance statistics and biographical details but also the results of their own laboratory experiments with high achievers. Their work makes a rather startling assertion: the trait we commonly call talent is highly overrated. Or, put another way, expert performers C whether in memory or surgery, ballet or computer programming C are nearly always made, not born.
21.	The birthday phenomenon found among soccer players is mentioned to
[A] stress the importance of professional training.
[B] spotlight the soccer superstars in the World Cup.
[C] introduce the topic of what makes expert performance.
[D] explain why some soccer teams play better than others.
22.	The word “mania” (Line 4, Paragraph 2) most probably means
[A] fun.
[B] craze.
[C] hysteria.
[D] excitement.
23.	According to Ericsson, good memory
[A] depends on meaningful processing of information.
[B] results from intuitive rather than cognitive exercises.
[C] is determined by genetic rather than psychological factors.
[D] requires immediate feedback and a high degree of concentration.
24.	Ericsson and his colleagues believe that
[A] talent is a dominating factor for professional success.
[B] biographical data provide the key to excellent performance.
[C] the role of talent tends to be overlooked.
[D] high achievers owe their success mostly to nurture.
25.	Which of the following proverbs is closest to the message the text tries to convey?
[A] “Faith will move mountains.”
[B] “One reaps what one sows.”
[C] “Practice makes perfect.”
[D] “Like father, like son.”
Text 2
For the past several years, the Sunday newspaper supplement Parade has featured a column called “Ask Marilyn.” People are invited to query Marilyn vos Savant, who at age 10 had tested at a mental level of someone about 23 years old; that gave her an IQ of 228 C the highest score ever recorded. IQ tests ask you to complete verbal and visual analogies, to envision paper after it has been folded and cut, and to deduce numerical sequences, among other similar tasks. So it is a bit confusing when vos Savant fields such queries from the average Joe (whose IQ is 100) as, What’s the difference between love and fondness? Or what is the nature of luck and coincidence? It’s not obvious how the capacity to visualize objects and to figure out numerical patterns suits one to answer questions that have eluded some of the best poets and philosophers.
Clearly, intelligence encompasses more than a score on a test. Just what does it mean to be smart? How much of intelligence can be specified, and how much can we learn about it from neurology, genetics, computer science and other fields?
The defining term of intelligence in humans still seems to be the IQ score, even though IQ tests are not given as often as they used to be. The test comes primarily in two forms: the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales (both come in adult and children’s version). Generally costing several hundred dollars, they are usually given only by psychologists, although variations of them populate bookstores and the World Wide Web. Superhigh scores like vos Savant’s are no longer possible, because scoring is now based on a statistical population distribution among age peers, rather than simply dividing the mental age by the chronological age and multiplying by 100. Other standardized tests, such as the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and the Graduate Record Exam (GRE), capture the main aspects of IQ tests.
Such standardized tests may not assess all the important elements necessary to succeed in school and in life, argues Robert J. Sternberg. In his article “How Intelligent Is Intelligence Testing?”, Sternberg notes that traditional test best assess analytical and verbal skills but fail to measure creativity and practical knowledge, components also critical to problem solving and life success. Moreover, IQ tests do not necessarily predict so well once populations or situations change. Research has found that IQ predicted leadership skills when the tests were given under low-stress conditions, but under high-stress conditions, IQ was negatively correlated with leadership C that is, it predicted the opposite. Anyone who has toiled through SAT will testify that test-taking skill also matters, whether it’s knowing when to guess or what questions to skip.
26.	Which of the following may be required in an intelligence test?
[A] Answering philosophical questions.
[B] Folding or cutting paper into different shapes.
[C] Telling the differences between certain concepts.
[D] Choosing words or graphs similar to the given ones.
27.	What can be inferred about intelligence testing from Paragraph 3?
[A] People no longer use IQ scores as an indicator of intelligence.
[B] More versions of IQ tests are now available on the Internet.
[C] The test contents and formats for adults and children may be different.
[D] Scientists have defined the important elements of human intelligence.
28.	People nowadays can no longer achieve IQ scores as high as vos Savant’s because
[A] the scores are obtained through different computational procedures.
[B] creativity rather than analytical skills is emphasized now.
[C] vos Savant’s case is an extreme one that will not repeat.
[D] the defining characteristic of IQ tests has changed.
29.	We can conclude from the last paragraph that
[A] test scores may not be reliable indicators of one’s ability.
[B] IQ scores and SAT results are highly correlated.
[C] testing involves a lot of guesswork.
[D] traditional test are out of date.
30.	What is the author’s attitude towards IQ tests?
[A] Supportive.
[B] Skeptical.
[C] Impartial.
[D] Biased.

During the past generation, the American middle-class family that once could count on hard work and fair play to keep itself financially secure had been transformed by economic risk and new realities. Now a pink slip, a bad diagnosis, or a disappearing spouse can reduce a family from solidly middle class to newly poor in a few months.
In just one generation, millions of mothers have gone to work, transforming basic family economics. Scholars, policymakers, and critics of all stripes have debated the social implications of these changes, but few have looked at the side effect: family risk has risen as well. Today’s families have budgeted to the limits of their new two-paycheck status. As a result, they have lost the parachute they once had in times of financial setback C a back-up earner (usually Mom) who could go into the workforce if the primary earner got laid off or fell sick. This “added-worker effect” could support the safety net offered by unemployment insurance or disability insurance to help families weather bad times. But today, a disruption to family fortunes can no longer be made up with extra income from an otherwise-stay-at-home partner.
During the same period, families have been asked to absorb much more risk in their retirement income. Steelworkers, airline employees, and now those in the auto industry are joining millions of families who must worry about interest rates, stock market fluctuation, and the harsh reality that they may outlive their retirement money. For much of the past year, President Bush campaigned to move Social Security to a saving-account model, with retirees trading much or all of their guaranteed payments for payments depending on investment returns. For younger families, the picture is not any better. Both the absolute cost of healthcare and the share of it borne by families have risen C and newly fashionable health-savings plans are spreading from legislative halls to Wal-Mart workers, with much higher deductibles and a large new dose of investment risk for families’ future healthcare. Even demographics are working against the middle class family, as the odds of having a weak elderly parent C and all the attendant need for physical and financial assistance C have jumped eightfold in just one generation.
From the middle-class family perspective, much of this, understandably, looks far less like an opportunity to exercise more financial responsibility, and a good deal more like a frightening acceleration of the wholesale shift of financial risk onto their already overburdened shoulders. The financial fallout has begun, and the political fallout may not be far behind.
31.	Today’s double-income families are at greater financial risk in that
[A] the safety net they used to enjoy has disappeared.

Text 4
It never rains but it pours. Just as bosses and boards have finally sorted out their worst accounting and compliance troubles, and improved their feeble corporation governance, a new problem threatens to earn them C especially in America C the sort of nasty headlines that inevitably lead to heads rolling in the executive suite: data insecurity. Left, until now, to odd, low-level IT staff to put right, and seen as a concern only of data-rich industries such as banking, telecoms and air travel, information protection is now high on the boss’s agenda in businesses of every variety.
Several massive leakages of customer and employee data this year C from organizations as diverse as Time Warner, the American defense contractor Science Applications International Corp and even the University of California, Berkeley C have left managers hurriedly peering into their intricate IT systems and business processes in search of potential vulnerabilities.
“Data is becoming an asset which needs to be guarded as much as any other asset,” says Haim Mendelson of Stanford University’s business school. “The ability to guard customer data is the key to market value, which the board is responsible for on behalf of shareholders.” Indeed, just as there is the concept of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), perhaps it is time for GASP, Generally Accepted Security Practices, suggested Eli Noam of New York’s Columbia Business School. “Setting the proper investment level for security, redundancy, and recovery is a management issue, not a technical one,” he says.
The mystery is that this should come as a surprise to any boss. Surely it should be obvious to the dimmest executive that trust, that most valuable of economic assets, is easily destroyed and hugely expensive to restore C and that few things are more likely to destroy trust than a company letting sensitive personal data get into the wrong hands.
The current state of affairs may have been encouraged C though not justified C by the lack of legal penalty (in America, but not Europe) for data leakage. Until California recently passed a law, American firms did not have to tell anyone, even the victim, when data went astray. That may change fast: lots of proposed data-security legislation is now doing the rounds in Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, the theft of information about some 40 million credit-card accounts in America, disclosed on June 17th, overshadowed a hugely important decision a day earlier by America’s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that puts corporate America on notice that regulators will act if firms fail to provide adequate data security.
36.	The statement “It never rains but it pours” is used to introduce
[A] the fierce business competition.
[B] the feeble boss-board relations.
[C] the threat from news reports.
[D] the severity of data leakage.
37.	According to Paragraph 2, some organizations check their systems to find out
[A] whether there is any weak point.
[B] what sort of data has been stolen.
[C] who is responsible for the leakage.
[D] how the potential spies can be located.
38.	In bringing up the concept of GASP the author is making the point that
[A] shareholders’ interests should be properly attended to.
[B] information protection should be given due attention.
[C] businesses should enhance their level of accounting security.
[D] the market value of customer data should be emphasized.
39.	According to Paragraph 4, what puzzles the author is that some bosses fail to
[A] see the link between trust and data protection.
[B] perceive the sensitivity of personal data.
[C] realize the high cost of data restoration.
[D] appreciate the economic value of trust.
40.	It can be inferred from Paragraph 5 that
[A] data leakage is more severe in Europe.
[B] FTC’s decision is essential to data security.
[C] California takes the lead in security legislation.
[D] legal penalty is a major solution to data leakage.

You are going to read a list of headings and a text about what parents are supposed to do to guide their children into adulthood. Choose a heading from the list A―G that best fits the meaning of each numbered part of the text (41-45). The first and last paragraphs of the text are not numbered. There are two extra headings that you do not need to use. Mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET 1. (10 points)

C. Place Time Limits on Leisure Activities
D. Talk about the Future on a Regular Basis
E. Help Kids Develop Coping Strategies
F. Help Your Kids Figure Out Who They Are
G. Build Your Kids’ Sense of Responsibility
How Can a Parent Help?
Mothers and fathers can do a lot to ensure a safe landing in early adulthood for their kids. Even if a job’s starting salary seems too small to satisfy an emerging adult’s need for rapid content, the transition from school to work can be less of a setback if the start-up adult is ready for the move. Here are a few measures, drawn from my book Ready or Not, Here Life Comes, that parents can take to prevent what I call “work-life unreadiness.”
大41家 http://www.TopSage.com
You can start this process when they are 11 or 12. Periodically review their emerging strengths and weaknesses with them and work together on any shortcomings, like difficulty in communicating well or collaborating. Also, identify the kinds of interests they keep coming back to, as these offer clues to the careers that will fit them best.
大42家 http://www.TopSage.com
Kids need a range of authentic role models C as opposed to members of their clique, pop stars and vaunted athletes. Have regular dinner-table discussions about people the family knows and how they got where they are. Discuss the joys and downsides of your own career and encourage your kids to form some ideas about their own future. When asked what they want to do, they should be discouraged from saying “I have no idea.” They can change their minds 200 times, but having only a foggy view of the future is of little good.
大43家 http://www.TopSage.com
Teachers are responsible for teaching kids how to learn; parents should be responsible for teaching them how to work. Assign responsibilities around the house and make sure homework deadlines are met. Encourage teenagers to take a part-time job. Kids need plenty of practice delaying gratification and deploying effective organizational skills, such as managing time and setting priorities.
大44家 http://www.TopSage.com
Playing video games encourages immediate content. And hours of watching TV shows with canned laughter only teaches kids to process information in a passive way. At the same time, listening through earphones to the same monotonous beats for long stretches encourages kids to stay inside their bubble instead of pursuing other endeavors. All these activities can prevent the growth of important communication and thinking skills and make it difficult for kids to develop the kind of sustained concentration they will need for most jobs.
大45家 http://www.TopSage.com
They should know how to deal with setbacks, stresses and feelings of inadequacy. They should also learn how to solve problems and resolve conflicts, ways to brainstorm and think critically. Discussions at home can help kids practice doing these things and help them apply these skills to everyday life situations.
What about the son or daughter who is grown but seems to be struggling and wandering aimlessly through early adulthood? Parents still have a major role to play, but now it is more delicate. They have to be careful not to come across as disappointed in their child. They should exhibit strong interest and respect for whatever currently interests their fledging adult (as naive or ill conceived as it may seem) while becoming a partner in exploring options for the future. Most of all, these new adults must feel that they are respected and supported by a family that appreciates them.

Part C
Directions:
Read the following text carefully and then translate the underlined segments into Chinese. Your translation should be written clearly on ANSWER SHEET 2. (10 points)
The study of law has been recognized for centuries as a basic intellectual discipline in European universities. However, only in recent years has it become a feature of undergraduate programs in Canadian universities. (46) Traditionally, legal learning has been viewed in such institutions as the special preserve of lawyers, rather than a necessary part of the intellectual equipment of an educated person. Happily, the older and more continental view of legal education is establishing itself in a number of Canadian universities and some have even begun to offer undergraduate degrees in law.
If the study of law is beginning to establish itself as part and parcel of a general education, its aims and methods should appeal directly to journalism educators. Law is a discipline which encourages responsible judgment. On the one hand, it provides opportunities to analyze such ideas as justice, democracy and freedom. (47) On the other, it links these concepts to everyday realities in a manner which is parallel to the links journalists forge on a daily basis as they cover and comment on the news. For example, notions of evidence and fact, of basic rights and public interest are at work in the process of journalistic judgment and production just as in courts of law. Sharpening judgment by absorbing and reflecting on law is a desirable component of a journalist’s intellectual preparation for his or her career.
(48) But the idea that the journalist must understand the law more profoundly than an ordinary citizen rests on an understanding of the established conventions and special responsibilities of the news media. Politics or, more broadly, the functioning of the state, is a major subject for journalists. The better informed they are about the way the state works, the better their reporting will be. (49) In fact, it is difficult to see how journalists who do not have a clear grasp of the basic features of the Canadian Constitution can do a competent job on political stories.
Furthermore, the legal system and the events which occur within it are primary subjects for journalists. While the quality of legal journalism varies greatly, there is an undue reliance amongst many journalists on interpretations supplied to them by lawyers. (50) While comment and reaction from lawyers may enhance stories, it is preferable for journalists to rely on their own notions of significance and make their own judgments. These can only come from a well-grounded understanding of the legal system.

2007年考研英语真题答案解析
SectionⅠUseofEnglish
1.【答案】［B］
【解析】词义辨析题，A.natives本地人；B.inhabitant居民；C.peoples民族；D.individuals个体。本文首句指出：到了1830年，原来的西班牙和葡萄牙殖民地变成了独立国家。本句解释了这些居住在摆脱殖民地地位而独立的国家的人们对于未来的态度。这里的这里没有限定范围是“本地人”，也没有提及不同的民族，更没有强调个体差异，因此排除其他选项。
2.【答案】［D］
【解析】词汇辨析题。A.confusedly困惑地；B.cheerfully高兴的；C.worried担心的；D.hopefully充满期待地从首句已知这些国家的居民摆脱了西班牙和葡萄牙的殖民统治，虽然文中没有提到独立的过程，但是历史告诉我们，殖民地人们要求独立的愿望是一直存在的，是迫切的，由此可以判断，成立独立国家是殖民地人们的愿望，因此居民们对未来充满了期待，故选择hopefully合适。
3.【答案】［A］
【解析】逻辑关系题。A.shared共有；B.forgot忘记；C.attained获得；D.rejected拒绝。本题所在的句子介绍了这些新独立国家的领导人们的治国理念。首先提到了许多领导人们在治国理念中达成共识的部分，这由本句和下一句的内容及第二段首句中的less agreement得到印证，先指出领导人之间理念上的相同之处，再指出他们之间存在的分歧，shared the ideas符合上下文逻辑关系，故为答案。
4.【答案】［C］
【解析】语义辨析题。A.related相关的；B.close接近的；C.open开着的；D.devoted投入的。本句提到的新国家领导人共同的治国理念包括议会制政府等。由这里的representative government，freedom of commerce and trade可以看出，这些都是先进的民主的治国方略，故此处的careers应为“向人才开放的职业”，这样才能让人们人尽其才，发挥自己的作用。其他三项都可以与介词to搭配使用，但放在此外，不符合上下文语义衔接关系。
5.【答案】［C］
【解析】语义辨析题。A.accessto接近；B.successionto继承；C.rightto的权利；D.returnto返回。从前面的“议会制政府”，“向人才开放的职业”，“商业和贸易自由”可以看出这里提到的是推动国家进步和发展，充分调动人们积极性的另一个理念“人们对私有财产的所有权”，故此处选择right.6.［答案］［D］［分析］词汇辨析题。A.Presumably大概的；B.Incidentally偶然的；C.Obviously显然的；D.Generally普遍的。因为这里没有表示与前一句内容相反或转折的信号词，可以判断本句承接上一句内容而来，继续介绍新的独立国家领导人都认同的理念。这里generally表示出后面内容是大家普遍的观点，符合这里的语义衔接关系，故为答案。
7.【答案】［B］
【解析】词汇辨析题。A.unique唯一的；B.common普通的；C.particular特殊的；D.typical典型的本句意为：他们普遍认为新国家应该是独立的主权国家，足够大，能够在经济上切实可行，由一套共同法律让各个新的独立国家联合起来。句中提到integrate，既然是“联合”，各国应该遵循一套共同的法律，故common符合文意。
8.【答案】［A］
【解析】语义辨析题。A.freedom自由；B.origin起源；C.impact影响；D.reform改革……本句涉及到领导人对待宗教的态度。从后面的内容可以看出领导人对尊哪种宗教信仰一种宗教，而禁止人们信仰其他宗教产生分歧，因此可以看出这里谈论的是宗教自由和教会地位的问题，这里的freedom of religion和the position of the church为并列关系。
9.【答案】［B］
【解析】逻辑关系题。A.therefore因此；B.however然而；C.indeed的确；D.moreover而且。第一段最后两句介绍了新成立的独立国家领导人之间在治国理念方面的共识，这里提到的是他们之间存在的分歧，显然两部分之间为转折关系，故使用however.本题误选在于没有正确判断本句和前文之间的逻辑关系。
10．【答案】［C］
【解析】词汇辨析题。A.with和…；B.about有关；C.among在…之中；D.by通过。本句表明各国领导人之间在宗教问题方面不那么有默契了，among表示“在……之间”，这里among the leadersship表范围。其他几个介词与后面内容搭配作状语时，都不表示范围。
11.【答案】［C］
【解析】词汇辨析题。A.allowed准许；B.preached宣扬；C.granted承认；D.funded资助本句对首句内容进行解释说明，指出罗马天主教过去在西班牙的地位：是西班牙国教，是唯一得到西班牙王室承认的。由句中的only可判断，西班牙王室只承认罗马天主教。各个选项中只有grant有“承认”之意，故为答案。
12．【答案】［D］
【解析】逻辑关系题。A.since因为；B.if如果；C.unless除非；D.while而。分析本句句意可以看出，前后两部分谈论的是领导人的两种不同观点：多数人致力于人保留天主教为新国家的官方宗教，一些领导人致力于终结不能有其他宗教信仰的状况。显然前后两部分之间存在对比关系，故使用While表示对比。本句前后两部分之间无假设关系和因果关系，因此排除其他选项。
13.【答案】［A］
【解析】固定搭配题。A.as作为；B.for为了；C.under在……之下；D.against反对。前一句提到罗马天主教为西班牙国教，本句承接前一句，指出大多数领导人希望保留天主教为官方宗教信仰，显然这里as the official religion of the newstates是方式状语，与maintain搭配使用，符合语意关系。
14.【答案】 ［C］
【解析】词汇辨析题。A.spread传播；B.interference干涉；C.exclusion排除；D.promised承诺。本句提到一些领导人与众不同的观点：结束不允许有其他宗教信仰的状况。可见，两拨人的观点截然不同，exclusion用在此处符合语境。这里使用spread，interference和influence与前面内容均不构成转折关系。
15.【答案】［B］
【解析】固定搭配题。A.support支持；B.cry哭喊；C.plea恳请；D.wish希望。本句与前一句内容有隐含的因果关系，这是由于一些领导人主张允许信仰其他宗教，因此保卫教会成为保守势力的战斗口号。这里rallyingcry为固定搭配。
16.【答案】［D］
【解析】固定搭配题。本句是对该段首句主题句的解释。从句中的inreturn可以看出，海地对玻利瓦尔的帮助并非无条件的，其条件就是后者承诺废除奴隶制度。这里promisetodosth.意为“答应做某事”。
17.【答案】［B］
【解析】语义辨析题。A.controlling正在统治的；B.former原来的；C.remaining遗留的；D.original原始的。本句提到到1854年为止，其他地区都废除了了奴隶制，只剩余西班牙的某些殖民地。如果选择remaining，则这里意为“西班牙残存的殖民地”，显然与文章第一段提到的“到1830年，原来的西班牙和葡萄牙殖民地都变成了独立的国家”相矛盾，因为这些国家之前都已独立，因此应选［B］，指西班牙的前殖民地国家。
18.【答案】［A］
【解析】语义辨析题。A.slower较慢；B.faster较快；C.easier较容易；D.tougher较难。上文提到玻利瓦尔承诺废除奴隶制，到1854年除了前西班牙殖民地外，其他地区都已废除奴隶制，本题所在句子指出了与此相反的情况：由于新独立的国家仍然需要这些政策所带来的收入，因此，停止印地安人上贡和对混血人种征税的早期承诺实现得颇为???。根据上下文可知，此处是说这个承诺实现得缓慢，不像废除奴隶制那样快，因此，答案为［A］。
19.【答案】［B］
【解析】词汇辩析题。A.created创建；B.produced产生，生产；C.contributed有助于；D.prefered更喜欢。本题所在部分意为“新国家仍然需要这些政策所带来的税收收入”，这些税收收入是这些policies带来的，这里使用produce意思相近，但后者有“产生，带来”之意，前者并无此意，排除。
20.【答案】［D］
【解析】词汇辨析题。A.puzzledby困惑；B.hostileto敌对；C.pessimisticto悲观；D.unpreparedto未准备好。本段前文一直在提人人平等，最后一句指出一种担心情绪：大众未对自治和民主做好准备。由于新的独立国家的人们刚刚摆脱了殖民统治，因此人们还没有充分了解和熟悉自治和民主，这里使用unpreparedfor符合语境。
　
　SectionⅡReadingComprehension
　Part A
　　Text 1
21.【答案】［C］
【解析】结构题。首段提到一个怪现象：出色的足球运动员更可能出生在一年内的前几个月而不是后几个月。在提出该现象之后，作者在该段未对其做进一步解释说明。这是典型的英文文章开篇模式，通过引用或举例的方式引出文章主题，显然作者介绍这一现象是为了引出下面的主题，因此因该在后的内容中寻找答案。通过浏览后面的内容可知，Ericsson和他的同事们致力于研究不同领域的技艺精湛的从业者取得成就的原因，作者在全文末段给出答案。因此可以判断提到的怪现象是用来引出主题，故［C］为答案。
22.【答案】［B］
【解析】识词题。第二段介绍了对首段提到的怪现象的四种推断性的解释，其中第三个解释中首先出现了soccer-madparents一词，既然是对足球疯狂的父母，那么他们选择在出现足球狂热的季节孕育孩子也不足为奇了，此处的soccermania与soccermad意思一致，考生可通过词汇复现这一线索解题。
23.【答案】［A］
【解析】细节题。在第三段Ericsson给出一个有关记忆的例子，然后在第四段对该题研究进行了说明。第二句明确指出好的记忆力是不天生的，而是由个人解码信息能力的强弱决定的，这与［A］意思一致，故该项为答案。
24.【答案】［D］
【解析】细节题。末段最后一句对Ericsson及其同事的研究结论进行了总结：那些技艺精湛的从业者，无论记忆路超群者，还是专家级外科医生，无论是卓越的芭蕾舞演员还是出色的计算机程序员，他们几乎都是后天练就的，而非天生的。［D］正是对该部分内容的归纳概括，故为答案。
25.【答案】［C］
【解析】主旨题。本题是一个典型的中心思想题，与以往考查形式不同的是，这里需要用一个常见成语对全文主旨进行归纳。开篇由优秀的足球运动员出生月份这个话题引出Ericsson对成功是基于天生还是后天这个问题的研究。第三段用一个记忆数字的例子说明练习的重要性。全文末段的出研究结论：那些取得巨大成就的人都是后天练就的，并非天生的。由此可以看出本文的主旨是成就是靠后天的勤奋，即不断的训练和练习取得的，［C］意为“熟能生巧”，与作者传递的信息一致，故为答案。
Text 2
26.【答案】［D］
【解析】细节题。该题目提问智力测试的内容，定位在文章首段，首句。智商测试让你完成语言和视觉类推。因此，D对verbal和visualanalogies进行了解释，故为正确答案。
27.【答案】［C］
【解析】推断题。该题目要推断第三段含义。找到主题句，第二句IQ测试的两种形式：一是斯坦福-比奈智力量化表，二是温切斯特智力量化表。因此，两个版本内容不同。故选C.
28.【答案】［A］
【解析】细节题。文章第三段，倒数第二句：象vosSavant那样的超高分数不可能再出现，因为现在的记分建立在同龄人的人口分布统计数字的基础上。而不仅仅是用智力年龄除以生理年龄再乘以100.可见，积分方式的变化是不会出现高分的原因。故选A.
29.【答案】［A］
【解析】推断题。文章尾段第三句提到：一旦人口或情况发生变化，智商测试就可能不准确。随后论证：当智商测试在压力小的环境中，能预测领导能力。在压力大的环境中，智商与领导力负相关，即，预测的内容正好相反。故选A.
30.【答案】［B］
【解析】主旨题。文章尾段暗示了作者的观点。该段第三句作者认为传统的测试对人的某方面能力没有考察到，同时认为测试结果依赖于环境。因此B怀疑态度。
　Text 3
31.【答案】［C］
【解析】推断题。第二段提到，家庭夫妻的双薪的副作用，家庭风险提高了。随后，作出解释，以前家庭主要经济支柱失业了或生病了，在家的另一方可以进入劳动力市场。但是现在，在这种情况下，家庭财富的中断不能得到弥补。因此，家庭易受经济变化影响。故选C.
32.【答案】［B］
【解析】细节题。第三段提到布什总统的计划：布什总统致力于将社会保障转换成储备帐户模式，让退休人员将有保障的退休金变成依赖于投资回报率的退休金。这里B是对部分内容的概括。
　33.【答案】［D］
【解析】细节题。第三段提到医疗储备计划，减免的部分增加了，会出现一些新的大的家庭未来的医疗投资风险，故选D.
34.【答案】［C］
【解析】推断题。在末段发表观点：经济上的不良后果开始出现，政治负面影响可能也不远了。由此可推断，作者认为经济问题解决不好必将导致政治问题。故选C.
35.【答案】［B］
【解析】主旨题。本题是标题型主旨大意题。作者在第二和第三段阐述了中产阶级家庭的经济风险，退休金风险和医疗保障风险增大。风险让这些家庭更加疲惫。文中多次出现risk一词，表明这些风险对中产阶级是雪上加霜。这与B中的onthecliff（在悬崖边上）语义相同。
Text 4
36.【答案】［D］
【解析】结构题。文中第一段的例子对应的论点是第二段的内容。这里的倾盆大雨是指美国公司遇到的新的麻烦：数据安全问题。故D正确。
37.【答案】［A］
【解析】细节题。文章第二段尾句：企业老板们面对数据泄露问题采取的措施是：经理们赶紧盯着他们复杂的IT系统和商业流程，以搜索可能存在的安全缺陷。因此A正确。
38.【答案】［B］
【解析】推断题。文章第三段提出EliNoam的观点：为数据安全、备份、恢复设立适当的投资标准是一个管理问题，不是技术问题。因此，他认为公司老板不重视数据的管理。综上所述，B为正确答案。
39.【答案】［A］
【解析】推断题。文章第四段第二句为主题句。信任是最有价值的经济资产，它很容易被毁掉，而修复信任需要花费巨资。没有什么能比一家公司让敏感的个人数据流到别有用心的人手里更能毁掉信任的了。因此，A为正确答案。
40.【答案】［D］
【解析】推断题。文章尾段首句为主题句，现在这种状况，虽然不合理，可能会由于缺乏对数据泄露的法律制裁而加剧。由此可以推断，法律制裁对于数据泄露的必要性。故选D.
Part B
41.【答案】［F］。
【解析】第二段全段没有转折词，末句出现了Also，可见该段前后内容一致，为递进关系。末句中出现代词they和them，指代首段提到的孩子，他有什么兴趣，最适合什么，因该是帮助孩子了解他们自身的优缺点，改正缺点。只有了解了自己是什么人，才知道自己适合什么。我们通过对该段中代词的把握以及对最后一个句子中提到的兴趣种类就可以判断41题选［F］。
42.【答案】［D］。
【解析】42题考生很容易错选成［A］，这是因为首句提到rolemodel，这与［A］中的goodexample一致。但是小标题的选择应该是对段落的整体把握，不是只关注部分细节内容。首句提到榜样之后，后面都没有谈到这一内容。显然该段主旨并榜样问题。后面内容中反复出现的一个关键是future，指出家长和孩子们要定期讨论对未来的设想，显然［D］为答案。
43.【答案】［B］。
【解析】本题所在段首句为主题句，指出父母应该教给孩子怎样工作。后面具体解释如何教会孩子们工作：给孩子分配家务，鼓励十几岁的孩子做兼职等。通过这些方式让孩子学会工作的技能。［B］是对主题句的同义转述，是对后细节内容的高度概括，故为答案。
44.【答案】［C］。
【解析】本段未出现明显的主题句，但全段都是在谈论一些娱乐性的业余生活的危害，作者提到玩电子游戏、长时间的看电视剧、长时间的用耳机听音乐等活动会妨碍重要的沟通和思考能力的发展，影响持续的注意力发展。结合首段内容可知，这里作者是向家长提建议，指出如何帮助孩子为未来的工作做好准备。虽然本段没有明确指出应该采取何种措施，由这里提到的危害可限制，这样才不会影响他某些方面能力的发展，故［C］为答案。
45.【答案】［E］。
【解析】本段提到孩子们需要某种节能，处理各种状况。第一、二句中出现dealwith，solve，resolve等词，表示孩子们需要应对、解决某些问题。由此可以推断，作者在本段中提到的是处理和应对各种情况的技能，这与［E］中的coping strategies不谋而合，故该项为答案。

　　To whom it may concern，As a senior student of the university，I am writing the letter to make some suggestions for improving the service of our university library.
　　On the whole，I think our library functions pretty well，but its service is far from being perfect.Firstly，it is quite convenient to arrange an inquiry desk at the circulation hall，which enables the students to ask questions whenever necessary.Then，with the help of a professional librarian，students can go through the procedures more efficiently.In addition，it would be most helpful if the students have access to the latest Issues of foreign magazines.Lastly，you'd better maintain strict order at the reading room.I frequently found myself Disturbed by certain students chatting and smoking there.
　　It is my sincere hope that you will take my advice into consideration and I hold that it will benefit both the students and the university faculty as well.
Sincerely yours，
Li Ming

　　How impressive the cartoon is in describing one of the most critical characteristic personalities concerning confidence！This cartoon depicts a picture of a football game with two players facing each other.One player is going to kick the ball while the goalkeeper is standing in front of a goal，ready to protect it.But both parties are losing their confidence.The striker magnifies the goalkeeper in his mind so that chances of shooting in are slim.Likewise，the goalkeeper minimizes his own image as if he couldn't defend the goal successfully.Obviously，both of the players in the picture don't have enough confidence and if you have little confidence，how can you achieve your goal in life？
　　The purpose of the picture is to emphasize the importance of self-confidence in our daily life.Confidence is very important in building a career.The belief of what one can achieve and succeed often spells the difference between success and failure.On account of the fast pace of life，competition goes increasingly fierce in all walks of life，imposing tremendous pressure on all individuals.The past few years have witnessed great increase in the difficulty of examinations and employment.Thus we must maintain powerful self-confidence and optimism in the face of challenges so as to survive and succeed.Confidence can be shown in the performance of many people.Take Liuxiang as an example.It is because of his Self-confidence that he never shrinks in front of other experienced players and works wonders again and again.On the contrary，some athletes do well in everyday training，but when facing other people they fail to present the best of themselves for the lack of self-confidence.As the saying goes，confidence is the first step to success！Only by building strong self-confidence can we move closer to our dreams.s，confidence is the first step to success！Only by building strong self-confidence can we move closer to our dreams.is the first step to success！Only by building strong self-confidence can we move closer to our dreams.s，confidence is the first step to success！Only by building strong self-confidence can we move closer to our dreams.

Text 1
In spite of “endless talk of difference,” American society is an amazing machine for homogenizing people. There is “the democratizing uniformity of dress and discourse, and the casualness and absence of deference” characteristic of popular culture. People are absorbed into “a culture of consumption” launched by the 19th-century department stores that offered “vast arrays of goods in an elegant atmosphere. Instead of intimate shops catering to a knowledgeable elite,” these were stores “anyone could enter, regardless of class or background. This turned shopping into a public and democratic act.” The mass media, advertising and sports are other forces for homogenization.
Immigrants are quickly fitting into this common culture, which may not be altogether elevating but is hardly poisonous. Writing for the National Immigration Forum, Gregory Rodriguez reports that today’s immigration is neither at unprecedented levels nor resistant to assimilation. In 1998 immigrants were 9.8 percent of population; in 1900, 13.6 percent. In the 10 years prior to 1990, 3.1 immigrants arrived for every 1,000 residents; in the 10 years prior to 1890, 9.2 for every 1,000. Now, consider three indices of assimilation -- language, home ownership and intermarriage.
The 1990 Census revealed that “a majority of immigrants from each of the fifteen most common countries of origin spoke English ‘well’ or ‘very well’ after ten years of residence.” The children of immigrants tend to be bilingual and proficient in English. “By the third generation, the original language is lost in the majority of immigrant families.” Hence the description of America as a “graveyard” for languages. By 1996 foreign-born immigrants who had arrived before 1970 had a home ownership rate of 75.6 percent, higher than the 69.8 percent rate among native-born Americans.
Foreign-born Asians and Hispanics “have higher rates of intermarriage than do U.S.-born whites and blacks.” By the third generation, one third of Hispanic women are married to non-Hispanics, and 41 percent of Asian-American women are married to non-Asians.
Rodriguez notes that children in remote villages around the world are fans of superstars like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks, yet “some Americans fear that immigrants living within the United States remain somehow immune to the nation’s assimilative power.”
Are there divisive issues and pockets of seething anger in America? Indeed. It is big enough to have a bit of everything. But particularly when viewed against America’s turbulent past, today’s social indices hardly suggest a dark and deteriorating social environment.
21.	The word “homogenizing” (Line 2, Paragraph 1) most probably means ________.
[A] identifying
[B] associating
[C] assimilating
[D] monopolizing
22.	According to the author, the department stores of the 19th century ________.
[A] played a role in the spread of popular culture
[B] became intimate shops for common consumers
[C] satisfied the needs of a knowledgeable elite
[D] owed its emergence to the culture of consumption
23.	The text suggests that immigrants now in the U.S. ________.
[A] are resistant to homogenization
[B] exert a great influence on American culture
[C] are hardly a threat to the common culture
[D] constitute the majority of the population
24.	Why are Arnold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks mentioned in Paragraph 5?
[A] To prove their popularity around the world.
[B] To reveal the public’s fear of immigrants.
[C] To give examples of successful immigrants.
[D] To show the powerful influence of American culture.
25.	In the author’s opinion, the absorption of immigrants into American society is ________.
[A] rewarding
[B] successful
[C] fruitless
[D] harmful
Text 2
Stratford-on-Avon, as we all know, has only one industry -- William Shakespeare -- but there are two distinctly separate and increasingly hostile branches. There is the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), which presents superb productions of the plays at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre on the Avon. And there are the townsfolk who largely live off the tourists who come, not to see the plays, but to look at Anne Hathaway’s Cottage, Shakespeare’s birthplace and the other sights.
The worthy residents of Stratford doubt that the theatre adds a penny to their revenue. They frankly dislike the RSC’s actors, them with their long hair and beards and sandals and noisiness. It’s all deliciously ironic when you consider that Shakespeare, who earns their living, was himself an actor (with a beard) and did his share of noise-making.
The tourist streams are not entirely separate. The sightseers who come by bus -- and often take in Warwick Castle and Blenheim Palace on the side -- don’t usually see the plays, and some of them are even surprised to find a theatre in Stratford. However, the playgoers do manage a little sight-seeing along with their playgoing. It is the playgoers, the RSC contends, who bring in much of the town’s revenue because they spend the night (some of them four or five nights) pouring cash into the hotels and restaurants. The sightseers can take in everything and get out of town by nightfall.
The townsfolk don’t see it this way and local council does not contribute directly to the subsidy of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Stratford cries poor traditionally. Nevertheless every hotel in town seems to be adding a new wing or cocktail lounge. Hilton is building its own hotel there, which you may be sure will be decorated with Hamlet Hamburger Bars, the Lear Lounge, the Banquo Banqueting Room, and so forth, and will be very expensive.
Anyway, the townsfolk can’t understand why the Royal Shakespeare Company needs a subsidy. (The theatre has broken attendance records for three years in a row. Last year its 1,431 seats were 94 percent occupied all year long and this year they’ll do better.) The reason, of course, is that costs have rocketed and ticket prices have stayed low.
It would be a shame to raise prices too much because it would drive away the young people who are Stratford’s most attractive clientele. They come entirely for the plays, not the sights. They all seem to look alike (though they come from all over) -- lean, pointed, dedicated faces, wearing jeans and sandals, eating their buns and bedding down for the night on the flagstones outside the theatre to buy the 20 seats and 80 standing-room tickets held for the sleepers and sold to them when the box office opens at 10:30 a.m.
26.	From the first two paragraphs, we learn that ________.
[A] the townsfolk deny the RSC’s contribution to the town’s revenue
[B] the actors of the RSC imitate Shakespeare on and off stage
[C] the two branches of the RSC are not on good terms
[D] the townsfolk earn little from tourism
27.	It can be inferred from Paragraph 3 that ________.
[A] the sightseers cannot visit the Castle and the Palace separately
[B] the playgoers spend more money than the sightseers
[C] the sightseers do more shopping than the playgoers
[D] the playgoers go to no other places in town than the theater
28.	By saying “Stratford cries poor traditionally” (Line 2-3, Paragraph 4), the author implies that ________.
[A] Stratford cannot afford the expansion projects
[B] Stratford has long been in financial difficulties
[C] the town is not really short of money
[D] the townsfolk used to be poorly paid
29.	According to the townsfolk, the RSC deserves no subsidy because ________.
[A] ticket prices can be raised to cover the spending
[B] the company is financially ill-managed
[C] the behavior of the actors is not socially acceptable
[D] the theatre attendance is on the rise
30.	From the text we can conclude that the author ________.
[A] is supportive of both sides
[B] favors the townsfolk’s view
[C] takes a detached attitude
[D] is sympathetic to the RSC
Text 3
When prehistoric man arrived in new parts of the world, something strange happened to the large animals. They suddenly became extinct. Smaller species survived. The large, slow-growing animals were easy game, and were quickly hunted to extinction. Now something similar could be happening in the oceans.
That the seas are being overfished has been known for years. What researchers such as Ransom Myers and Boris Worm have shown is just how fast things are changing. They have looked at half a century of data from fisheries around the world. Their methods do not attempt to estimate the actual biomass (the amount of living biological matter) of fish species in particular parts of the ocean, but rather changes in that biomass over time. According to their latest paper published in Nature, the biomass of large predators (animals that kill and eat other animals) in a new fishery is reduced on average by 80% within 15 years of the start of exploitation. In some long-fished areas, it has halved again since then.
Dr. Worm acknowledges that these figures are conservative. One reason for this is that fishing technology has improved. Today’s vessels can find their prey using satellites and sonar, which were not available 50 years ago. That means a higher proportion of what is in the sea is being caught, so the real difference between present and past is likely to be worse than the one recorded by changes in catch sizes. In the early days, too, longlines would have been more saturated with fish. Some individuals would therefore not have been caught, since no baited hooks would have been available to trap them, leading to an underestimate of fish stocks in the past. Furthermore, in the early days of longline fishing, a lot of fish were lost to sharks after they had been hooked. That is no longer a problem, because there are fewer sharks around now.
Dr. Myers and Dr. Worm argue that their work gives a correct baseline, which future management efforts must take into account. They believe the data support an idea current among marine biologists, that of the “shifting baseline.” The notion is that people have failed to detect the massive changes which have happened in the ocean because they have been looking back only a relatively short time into the past. That matters because theory suggests that the maximum sustainable yield that can be cropped from a fishery comes when the biomass of a target species is about 50% of its original levels. Most fisheries are well below that, which is a bad way to do business.
31.	The extinction of large prehistoric animals is noted to suggest that ________.
[A] large animal were vulnerable to the changing environment
[B] small species survived as large animals disappeared
[C] large sea animals may face the same threat today
[D] slow-growing fish outlive fast-growing ones
32.	We can infer from Dr. Myers and Dr. Worm’s paper that ________.
[A] the stock of large predators in some old fisheries has reduced by 90%
[B] there are only half as many fisheries as there were 15 years ago
[C] the catch sizes in new fisheries are only 20% of the original amount
[D] the number of larger predators dropped faster in new fisheries than in the old
33.	By saying "these figures are conservative" (Line 1, paragraph 3), Dr. Worm means that ________.
[A] fishing technology has improved rapidly
[B] the catch-sizes are actually smaller than recorded
[C] the marine biomass has suffered a greater loss
[D] the data collected so far are out of date
34.	Dr. Myers and other researchers hold that ________.
[A] people should look for a baseline that can work for a longer time
[B] fisheries should keep their yields below 50% of the biomass
[C] the ocean biomass should be restored to its original level
[D] people should adjust the fishing baseline to the changing situation
35.	The author seems to be mainly concerned with most fisheries’ ________.
[A] management efficiency
[B] biomass level
[C] catch-size limits
[D] technological application
Text 4
Many things make people think artists are weird. But the weirdest may be this: artists’ only job is to explore emotions, and yet they choose to focus on the ones that feel bad.
This wasn’t always so. The earliest forms of art, like painting and music, are those best suited for expressing joy. But somewhere from the 19th century onward, more artists began seeing happiness as meaningless, phony or, worst of all, boring, as we went from Wordsworth’s daffodils to Baudelaire’s flowers of evil.
You could argue that art became more skeptical of happiness because modern times have seen so much misery. But it’s not as if earlier times didn’t know perpetual war, disaster and the massacre of innocents. The reason, in fact, may be just the opposite: there is too much damn happiness in the world today.
After all, what is the one modern form of expression almost completely dedicated to depicting happiness? Advertising. The rise of anti-happy art almost exactly tracks the emergence of mass media, and with it, a commercial culture in which happiness is not just an ideal but an ideology.
People in earlier eras were surrounded by reminders of misery. They worked until exhausted, lived with few protections and died young. In the West, before mass communication and literacy, the most powerful mass medium was the church, which reminded worshippers that their souls were in danger and that they would someday be meat for worms. Given all this, they did not exactly need their art to be a bummer too.
Today the messages the average Westerner is surrounded with are not religious but commercial, and forever happy. Fast-food eaters, news anchors, text messengers, all smiling, smiling, smiling. Our magazines feature beaming celebrities and happy families in perfect homes. And since these messages have an agenda -- to lure us to open our wallets -- they make the very idea of happiness seem unreliable. “Celebrate!” commanded the ads for the arthritis drug Celebrex, before we found out it could increase the risk of heart attacks.
But what we forget -- what our economy depends on us forgetting -- is that happiness is more than pleasure without pain. The things that bring the greatest joy carry the greatest potential for loss and disappointment. Today, surrounded by promises of easy happiness, we need art to tell us, as religion once did, Memento mori: remember that you will die, that everything ends, and that happiness comes not in denying this but in living with it. It’s a message even more bitter than a clove cigarette, yet, somehow, a breath of fresh air.
36.	By citing the examples of poets Wordsworth and Baudelaire, the author intends to show that ________.
[A] poetry is not as expressive of joy as painting or music
[B] art grows out of both positive and negative feelings
[C] poets today are less skeptical of happiness
[D] artists have changed their focus of interest
37.	The word “bummer” (Line 5, paragraph 5) most probably means something ________.
[A] religious
[B] unpleasant
[C] entertaining
[D] commercial
38.	In the author’s opinion, advertising ________.
[A] emerges in the wake of the anti-happy art
[B] is a cause of disappointment for the general public
[C] replaces the church as a major source of information
[D] creates an illusion of happiness rather than happiness itself
39.	We can learn from the last paragraph that the author believes ________.
[A] happiness more often than not ends in sadness
[B] the anti-happy art is distasteful but refreshing
[C] misery should be enjoyed rather than denied
[D] the anti-happy art flourishes when economy booms

40.	Which of the following is true of the text?
[A] Religion once functioned as a reminder of misery.
[B] Art provides a balance between expectation and reality.
[C] People feel disappointed at the realities of modern society.
[D] Mass media are inclined to cover disasters and deaths.

On the north bank of the Ohio river sits Evansville, Ind., home of David Williams, 52, and of a riverboat casino (a place where gambling games are played). During several years of gambling in that casino, Williams, a state auditor earning $35,000 a year, lost approximately $175,000. He had never gambled before the casino sent him a coupon for $20 worth of gambling.
He visited the casino, lost the $20 and left. On his second visit he lost $800. The casino issued to him, as a good customer, a "Fun Card", which when used in the casino earns points for meals and drinks, and enables the casino to track the user’s gambling activities. For Williams, those activities become what he calls "electronic heroin".
(41) ________. In 1997 he lost $21,000 to one slot machine in two days. In March 1997 he lost $72,186. He sometimes played two slot machines at a time, all night, until the boat docked at 5 a.m., then went back aboard when the casino opened at 9 a.m. Now he is suing the casino, charging that it should have refused his patronage because it knew he was addicted. It did know he had a problem.
In March 1998 a friend of Williams’s got him involuntarily confined to a treatment center for addictions, and wrote to inform the casino of Williams’s gambling problem. The casino included a photo of Williams among those of banned gamblers, and wrote to him a “cease admissions” letter. Noting the medical/psychological nature of problem gambling behavior, the letter said that before being readmitted to the casino he would have to present medical/psychological information demonstrating that patronizing the casino would pose no threat to his safety or well-being.
(42) ________.
The Wall Street Journal reports that the casino has 24 signs warning: “Enjoy the fun... and always bet with your head, not over it.” Every entrance ticket lists a toll-free number for counseling from the Indiana Department of Mental Health. Nevertheless, Williams’s suit charges that the casino, knowing he was “helplessly addicted to gambling,” intentionally worked to “lure” him to “engage in conduct against his will.” Well.
(43) ________.
The fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders says “pathological gambling” involves persistent, recurring and uncontrollable pursuit less of money than of thrill of taking risks in quest of a windfall.
(44) ________. Pushed by science, or what claims to be science, society is reclassifying what once were considered character flaws or moral failings as personality disorders akin to physical disabilities.
(45) ________.
Forty-four states have lotteries, 29 have casinos, and most of these states are to varying degrees dependent on -- you might say addicted to -- revenues from wagering. And since the first Internet gambling site was created in 1995, competition for gamblers’ dollars has become intense. The Oct. 28 issue of Newsweek reported that 2 million gamblers patronize 1,800 virtual casinos every week. With $3.5 billion being lost on Internet wagers this year, gambling has passed pornography as the Web’s most profitable business.
[A]	Although no such evidence was presented, the casino’s marketing department continued to pepper him with mailings. And he entered the casino and used his Fun Card without being detected.
[B]	It is unclear what luring was required, given his compulsive behavior. And in what sense was his will operative?
[C]	By the time he had lost $5,000 he said to himself that if he could get back to even, he would quit. One night he won $5,500, but he did not quit.
[D]	Gambling has been a common feature of American life forever, but for a long time it was broadly considered a sin, or a social disease. Now it is a social policy: the most important and aggressive promoter of gambling in America is the government.
[E]	David Williams’s suit should trouble this gambling nation. But don’t bet on it.
[F]	It is worrisome that society is medicalizing more and more behavioral problems, often defining as addictions what earlier, sterner generations explained as weakness of will.
[G]	The anonymous, lonely, undistracted nature of online gambling is especially conducive to compulsive behavior. But even if the government knew how to move against Internet gambling, what would be its grounds for doing so?

Is it true that the American intellectual is rejected and considered of no account in his society? I am going to suggest that it is not true. Father Bruckberger told part of the story when he observed that it is the intellectuals who have rejected America. But they have done more than that. They have grown dissatisfied with the role of intellectual. It is they, not America, who have become anti-intellectual.
First, the object of our study pleads for definition. What is an intellectual? 46) I shall define him as an individual who has elected as his primary duty and pleasure in life the activity of thinking in a Socratic (苏格拉底) way about moral problems. He explores such problems consciously, articulately, and frankly, first by asking factual questions, then by asking moral questions, finally by suggesting action which seems appropriate in the light of the factual and moral information which he has obtained. 47) His function is analogous to that of a judge, who must accept the obligation of revealing in as obvious a manner as possible the course of reasoning which led him to his decision.
This definition excludes many individuals usually referred to as intellectuals -- the average scientist, for one. 48) I have excluded him because, while his accomplishments may contribute to the solution of moral problems, he has not been charged with the task of approaching any but the factual aspects of those problems. Like other human beings, he encounters moral issues even in the everyday performance of his routine duties -- he is not supposed to cook his experiments, manufacture evidence, or doctor his reports. 49) But his primary task is not to think about the moral code which governs his activity, any more than a businessman is expected to dedicate his energies to an exploration of rules of conduct in business. During most of his waking life he will take his code for granted, as the businessman takes his ethics.
The definition also excludes the majority of teachers, despite the fact that teaching has traditionally been the method whereby many intellectuals earn their living. 50) They may teach very well and more than earn their salaries, but most of them make little or no independent reflections on human problems which involve moral judgment. This description even fits the majority of eminent scholars. Being learned in some branch of human knowledge is one thing, living in "public and illustrious thoughts,” as Emerson would say, is something else.

 【解析】词汇辨析题 本题目选择动词，所在句子的主语、宾语提供信息决定答案。句子叙述到the federal government must support job training programs, _____ the minimum wage, and fund more low-cost housing.“联邦政府必须提供就业培训项目,…最低工资标准，资助更多低收入家庭。”
选项A.raise增加，提高；
B. add加；
C. take 拿来；
D. keep保留。
不难发现，句子中“___the minimum wage”与前面的短语“support job training program提供就业培训项目”和后面的短语“fund more low-cost housing 资助更多低收入家庭”是并列关系，是政府为无家可归者提供的服务。由此提供信息确定选择“提高”之意。选项A.raise增加，提高，“提高最低工资标准”，符合句子含义；选项B. add加，该词指数量的增加，不符合句子含义；选项C. take 拿来，该词不能与“最低工资标准”连用；选项D. keep保留，“保留最低工资标准”，虽然这个短语意义完整，但是不能与前后的政府帮助无家可归者的举动构成并列。因此，正确答案为A。
5. 【答案】[D] 
【解析】语意辨析题 本题目选择副词，在句子中限定范围。句子叙述到_____everyone agrees on the numbers of Americans who are homeless.“…每个人同意美国无家可归者的数量。”
选项A. generally 一般来说；  
B. almost 几乎；选项
C. hardly 几乎不…（常用倒装）；
D. not 置于句首表示部分否定，译为“并不是…”。
不难发现，由于本题包含反义选项，而上文又没有提示，因此应先把下一句中的第6、7两题做出，本题的答案才会迎刃而解。第6题所在的语境句意为“人们对此的估计数字从六十万到三百万不等”。而第7题又说“尽管这一数字可能不同，分析家们却在另外一件事情上的确达成了一致意见”。因此，本题答案应选D. Not，本句意思为“关于美国无家可归者的数量，众说不一”。
6. 【答案】[C] 
 【解析】词汇辨析题 句子中的主语、宾语以及介词决定所选择的动词。句子叙述到Estimates ____ anywhere from 600,000 to 3 million.“估计数字…60万到3百万之间。”
选项A. cover覆盖、包括；
B. change改变、变化；
C. range在某范围中变化；
D. differ不同。
不难发现， 句子中要选择动词与 “from 600,000 to 3 million”构成搭配，句子提供信息确定选择“在…范围”之意。选项A. cover覆盖、包括，不能与 “from…to…”构成搭配；选项B. change改变、变化，该词所指的变化是无规律的变化，当然就不涉及在范围内变化的含义；选项C. range在某范围中变化，符合语句含义；选项D. differ不同，一般组成 “differ from…”短语，译为“与…不同”，不符合句子含义。因此，正确答案为C。
7.【答案】[B] 
【解析】逻辑关系题 本题目选择逻辑关系词，前后两句的逻辑关系决定答案。____ the figure may vary, analysts do agree on another matter:…“…（人们估计的）数字不同，分析家们对另一个问题的意见还是完全一致的。”
选项A. Now that既然；
B. Although虽然…但是；
C. Provided 假设；
D. Except 除去。
不难发现，本题所在的语境句中，前文中的may vary与后文中的do agree互为反义，确定二者为转折让步关系。因此，正确答案为B，句子译为“虽然（人们估计的）数字不同，分析家们对另一个问题的意见还是完全一致的”。
8. 【答案】[C] 
 【解析】词汇辨析题 本题目选择动词的现在分词形式，句子中的主语提供信息决定答案。Although the figure may vary, analysts do agree on another matter: that the number of the homeless is______.“虽然（人们估计的）数字不同，分析家们对另一个问题的意见还是完全一致的：无家可归者的人数正在…。”
选项A. inflating 膨胀；
B. expanding发展、扩张；
C. increasing增加；
D. extending扩充、扩大。
不难发现，句子中“the number of homeless is___” 提供信息确定选择“增加，膨胀”之意。选项A. inflating 膨胀，超过既定标准（尤指通货膨胀）；选项B. expanding发展、扩张，体积增大；选项C. increasing增加，指数量增加；选项D. extending扩充、扩大，指形状变化、拉伸。因此，正确答案为C。语境句意为“无家可归者的数量一直在增加”。
9. 【答案】[A] 
 【解析】词汇辨析题 本题目选择动词，句子中的主语、宾语提供信息决定答案。句子叙述到One of the federal government’s studies ____ that the number of the homeless will reach nearly 19 million by the end of this decade.“联邦政府的一项研究…无家可归者的数量在近十年内将会达到大约1900万。”选择动词，主语和宾语提供信息确定答案。
选项A. predicts预测、预计；
B. displays展示；
C. proves证明；
D. discovers发现。
不难发现，句子中“that the number of the homeless will reach nearly 19 million by the end of this decade. 无家可归者的数量在近十年内将会达到大约1900万。” “近十年会达到1900万”表达未来的状况，确定选择“预测”之意。因此，正确答案为A。
10. 【答案】[A]

B. track追踪；
C. sustain承受、支持、供养；
D. dismiss解散。
不难发现, 本文前两段提出无家可归者的问题并略加分析，本段开始解决方法的探讨。句子提供信息确定选择“帮助”之意。选项A. assist帮助，“想办法帮助这些日益增加的无家可归者这一任务变得非常困难”，符合句子含义，符合文章中心；选项B. track追踪，，“想办法追踪这些日益增加的无家可归者这一任务变得非常困难”，不符合句子含义；选项C. sustain承受、支持、供养，“想办法支持这些日益增加的无家可归者这一任务变得非常困难”，符合句子含义，但是与上文的内容“政府提供相关计划帮助无家可归者”却没有联系；选项D. dismiss解散，，“想办法帮助这些日益增加的无家可归者这一任务变得非常困难”，符合句子含义，但是与上文的内容“政府提供相关计划帮助无家可归者”却没有联系。因此，正确答案为A。
11.【答案】[C]
 【解析】逻辑关系题 本题目选择逻辑关系词，体现前后两句的逻辑关系。句子叙述到___when homeless people individuals manage to find a ___that will give them three meals a day and a place to sleep at night, a good number still spend the bulk of each day ___ the street. “…当无家可归者找到…能提供一日三餐，晚上能睡觉，还是有很多人每天大部分时间…街头。”
选项A. Hence 因此；
B. But 但是；
C. Even即使；
D. Only 仅仅。
不难发现，前、后句子之间体现出让步关系。选项A. Hence 因此，表示因果关系，与本句逻辑关系不符；选项B. But 但是，表示转折关系，与本句逻辑关系不符；选项C. Even即使，表示让步关系，与本句逻辑关系相符，句子译为“当无家可归者找到地方能提供一日三餐，晚上能睡觉，还是有很多人每天大部分时间流浪街头”；选项D. Only 仅仅，表示递进关系，与本句逻辑关系不符。因此，正确答案为C。
12. 【答案】[B]
【解析】词汇/语法结构辨析题 本题目选择名词，同时这个名词由定语从句来修饰。句子叙述到even when homeless people individuals manage to find a ___that will give them three meals a day and a place to sleep at night,“即使无家可归者最终能够找到一个…，可以给他们提供一日三餐和夜里睡觉的地方”。
选项A. lodging寄宿处；
B. shelter庇护所、避难所；
C. dwelling住处；
D. house房屋。
不难发现，定语从句“that will give them three meals a day and a place to sleep at night 能够提供一日三餐和晚上睡觉的场所”确定选择“庇护所或避难所”之意。选项A. lodging寄宿处，因为无家可归者人数众多，找到寄宿的地方不合常理；选项B. shelter庇护所、避难所，符合句子含义；C. dwelling住处，指正常的居住场所，显然与无家可归者的景况不符；D. house房屋，显然无家可归者找到正规的居家之房屋不符合常理。因此，正确答案为B。
13. 【答案】[D]
 【解析】词汇辨析题 本题目选择动词的现在分词，在句子中充当宾语补足语。句子叙述到a good number still spend the bulk of each day___ the street.“很多人仍然每天大部分时间…街头。”
选项A. searching搜寻；

D. wandering游荡、徘徊、流浪。
不难发现，无家可归者是流浪街头的。选项A. searching 搜寻，不符合句子含义；选项B. strolling 漫步、闲逛，指悠闲自在的走，显然不符合句子含义；选项C. crowing 拥挤，该词是不及物动词，不能直接连用名词；选项D. wandering 流浪，符合句子含义。因此，正确答案为D。
14. 【答案】[C]

B. once一旦；
C. while表示转折关系，意为“尽管”；
D. whereas表示对比关系。
不难发现，句子中“即不吸毒也不饮酒”与“缺乏日常技巧”构成转折关系。因此，正确答案为C。
15. 【答案】[C]
 【解析】词汇辨析题 本题目选择名词，句子中的宾语名词决定所选择的定语（名词）。句子叙述到simply lack the everyday ___skills needed to turn their lives ___. “就是缺乏让自己生活变…的…技巧”。
选项A. life生活、生命；
B. existence存在；
C. survival生存、存活；
D. maintenance维护、坚持、生活费用。
不难发现，“everyday日常的”提供信息确定是一种生活、生存技巧。尤其是过去分词短语“needed to turn their lives ___.”确定选择“生存”之意。选项A. life skills 生活技巧，指生活中的一些常识或者窍门等，与句子含义不符；选项B. existence skill存在技巧，没有该短语搭配；选项C. survival skill 生存技巧，符合句子含义；选项D. maintenance skills 维护技巧，与句子含义不符。因此，正确答案为C。

选项A. complex复杂的；
B. comprehensive综合的、全面的；
C. complementary补充的、互补的；
D. compensating补偿的。
不难发现，句子中空格后面定语从句中的many一词；由于要满足无家可归者的许多要求（many needs of the homeless），所以这份计划应该是考虑周全、无所不包的。选项A. complex复杂的，“复杂的计划”与“解决这些无家可归者的各种需求”没有直接联系；选项B. comprehensive综合的、全面的，“全面的计划”与“解决这些无家可归者的各种需求”直接关联，符合句子含义；选项C. complementary补充的、互补的，，“互补的的计划”，句子中只提到一种计划，何谈“互补”；选项D. compensating补偿的，，“补偿的计划”与“解决这些无家可归者的各种需求”没有直接联系。因此，正确答案为B。
18. 【答案】[C]
 【解析】逻辑关系题 本题目选择逻辑关系词，前后两句的逻辑关系决定答案。句子叙述到_____Edward Zlotkowski, director of community service at Bentley College in Massachusetts, ____it, “There has to be _____of programs. What we need is a package deal. 像马塞诸塞州本特里学院社区服务部主任Edward Zlotkowski所…的：“各种项目必须…运行，我们需要的是一揽子计划”。
选项A. So 因此（因果关系，强调结果）；
B. Since既然（因果关系）；
C. As 正如（引导非限制性定语从句，与前文表示层进关系）；

19. 【答案】[A]
【解析】词汇辨析题 本题目选择动词，在句子中充当谓语动词。句子中的主语和宾语决定所选择的动词。句子叙述到Edward Blotkowsk___ it,“There has to be ___of programs. What we need is a package deal.” 提供信息确定选择“表达，说明”之意。选项A. puts口语中和正式场合宣讲是表示“说”；选项B. interprets口译，解释；选项C. assumes认为；选项D. makes 制造。因此，正确答案为A。

不难发现，句子中“一揽子计划”提供的信息确定选择“协调”之意。选项A. supervision监督、管理，与句子含义不符；选项B. manipulation操作、处理，与句子含义不符；选项C. regulation管理、调整，与句子含义不符；选项D. coordination协调。综合前文中的comprehensive programs that address the many needs of the homeless（应对无家可归者多方面需求的综合性计划）和后文中的a package deal（一揽子交易），不难选出与此意接近的coordination。因此，正确答案为D。
全文翻译无家可归者在美国所占的比例越来越大。而且，无家可归者所占的比例已经大到地方政府都无法应对的地步。为了帮助无家可归者走向独立，联邦政府必须支持就业培训项目，提高最低工资标准和资助修建更多的廉价住房。
   对于美国到底有多少无家可归者，大家的意见并不一致，估计是在60万到3000万之间。尽管人们估计的数字可能各不相同，分析家们对另外一个问题的意见却是一致的：无家可归者的人数正在增长。联邦政府的一项研究预测，在目前这个十年结束之前，无家可归者的数量将接近1900万。
   想办法帮助这些越来越多的无家可归者的任务变得越来越艰巨。即使无家可归者找到了避难所，能提供一日三餐，晚上能睡觉，还是会有很多人每天大部分时间流落街头。部分问题在于许多无家可归的成年人都是酒鬼或者是瘾君子，而且相当多的无家可归者都有严重的精神病。还有许多人虽然不酗酒吸毒，精神也正常，但就是缺乏让自己生活好转的基本能力。《波士顿环球日报》记者克里斯雷迪认为只有通过全面规划来解决这些无家可归者的各种需求，此局面才有可能得到改善。用马萨诸塞州本特里学院社区服务部主任艾德华泽洛特科瓦斯基的话来说就是：“各种规划必须协调运作，我们需要的是一揽子计划”。

第六段确定段落内容方向的语句是Are there divisive issues and pockets of seething anger in America? 美国存在分裂问题和骚动吗?
不难发现，这篇文章围绕着美国的移民问题来展开。
题目解析：
21. 【答案】[C] 
【解析】该题将识别的短语“homogenizing”在文章中定位到第一段首句In spite of “endless talk of difference,” American society is an amazing machine for homogenizing people.作为识词题，按照“方位论原则”：在识别词汇后面找表示“解释说明，逻辑关系”的表达，或者向前面找平行结构。在词汇前面出现。“In spite of “endless talk of difference,””，表达的是in spite of引起的转折关系。因此，homogenizing应与前文中的difference构成反义，只有C. assimilating“同化”符合题意。因此答案为C。
22. 【答案】[A] 
【解析】细节题.该题利用定位词“the department stores of the 19th century”定位到文章第一段People are absorbed into “a culture of consumption” launched by the 19th-century department storesthat offered ‘vast arrays of goods in an elegant atmosphere. “人们融入了19世纪百货商店倡导的“消费文化”，这些百货商店有幽雅的环境，提供各式各样的商品”。可见，the culture of consumption是由这些百货商店发起的。选项A. played a role in the spread of popular culture.在大众文化传播方面发挥作用，与相关信息句动作“融入了19世纪百货商店倡导的消费文化”直接关联；选项B. became intimate shops for common consumers.成为普通消费者的私人商店，与相关信息句动作“融入了19世纪百货商店倡导的消费文化，这些百货商店有幽雅的环境，提供各式各样的商品”没有任何关联；选项C. satisfied the needs of a knowledgeable elite.满足有知识的精英们的需求，与相关信息句动作“融入了19世纪百货商店倡导的消费文化，这些百货商店有幽雅的环境，提供各式各样的商品”没有任何关联；选项D. owed its emergence to the culture of consumption.商店的出现是消费文化出现的结果，与相关信息句动作“融入了19世纪百货商店倡导的消费文化，这些百货商店有幽雅的环境，提供各式各样的商品”没有任何关联。因此，正确答案为A. played a role in the spread of popular culture在大众文化传播方面发挥作用。
23. 【答案】[C] 
【解析】细节题.该题利用定位词“immigrants”定位到文章第二段Immigrants are quickly fitting into this common culture, which may not be altogether elevating but is hardly poisonous.“移民很快适应了这一共同文化，虽然这种文化可能不会引人向上，但也不会毒害人们。” 选项A. are resistant to homogenization. 拒绝均质化，与相关信息句动作“很快适应了这一共同文化，虽然这种文化可能不会引人向上，但也不会毒害人们”没有任何关联；选项B. exert a great influence on American culture.对美国文化施加重大影响，与相关信息句动作“很快适应了这一共同文化，虽然这种文化可能不会引人向上，但也不会毒害人们”没有任何关联；选项     C. are hardly a threat to the common culture. 对公共文化几乎没有威胁，与相关信息句动作“很快适应了这一共同文化，虽然这种文化可能不会引人向上，但也不会毒害人们”直接关联，动作“对公共文化几乎威胁”对应于“不会毒害人们”，体现“同意替换”的关系；选项     D. constitute the majority of the population. 占美国绝大多数人口，与相关信息句动作“很快适应了这一共同文化，虽然这种文化可能不会引人向上，但也不会毒害人们”没有任何关联。因此，正确答案为C. are hardly a threat to the common culture对公共文化几乎没有威胁。
24. 【答案】[D] 
【解析】结构题.该题将例子“Amold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks”定位到文章第五段Rodriguez notes that  children in remote villages around world are fans of superstars like Amold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks, yet “some Americans fear that immigrants living within the United States remain somehow immune to the nation’s assimilative power.”根据结构题方位论原则，找例子对应的论点句。因此，例子后面相邻的句子yet “some Americans fear that immigrants living within the United States remain somehow immune to the nation’s assimilative power.”“但是一些美国人担心住在美国的一些移民却不知为何没有受到该国同化作用的影响。”是论点。选项A. To prove their popularity around the world. 证明他们在世界的受欢迎程度，与相关信息句动作“担心住在美国的一些移民却不知为何没有受到该国同化作用的影响”没有任何关联；选项     B. To reveal the public’s fear of immigrants.表明人们对移民的恐惧，与相关信息句动作“担心住在美国的一些移民却不知为何没有受到该国同化作用的影响”没有任何关联；选项C. To give examples of successful immigrants.给成功移民举例子，与相关信息句动作“担心住在美国的一些移民却不知为何没有受到该国同化作用的影响”没有任何关联；选项D. To show the powerful influence of American culture.表明美国文化的巨大影响力，与相关信息句动作“担心住在美国的一些移民却不知为何没有受到该国同化作用的影响”直接关联，动作“担心为何没有受到该国同化作用的影响”对应于“表明美国文化的巨大影响”，体现 “同意替换”的关系。因此，正确答案为D. To show the powerful influence of American culture表明美国文化的巨大影响力。
25. 【答案】[B] 
【解析】主旨题.该题作为主旨题反映作者观点态度的题目，根据“方位论原则”：作者的观点体现在文章尾段的主题句或倒数第二段体现“I”的句子中。题目定位到文章尾段主题句But particularly when viewed against America’s turbulent past, today’s social indices hardly suggest a dark and deteriorating social environment.“但是，当审视美国过去的骚动时，当今的美国社会各项指标不能表明社会环境变得腐败黑暗”，体现作者的态度是美国社会当前的现状还好。因此，正确答案为B. successful  成功的。
全文翻译尽管人们对于美国社会的差异性有没完没了的争议，美国还是一部神奇的同化国民的机器。美国社会呈现出“服饰和话语趋于平民化、一致化，自在随意和尊重缺失”通俗文化的特点。人们融入了19世纪百货商店倡导的“消费文化”。与那些迎合知识精英的优雅舒适的商店不同，这些百货商店有优雅的环境，提供各式各样的商品，不论阶层和背景如何，任何人都可以进入。从而使得购物成为一种公众的、民主的行为。而均质化的其他推动力还包括大众传媒、广告和体育。
    移民很快适应了这一共同文化，虽然这种文化可能不会引人向上，但也不会毒害人们。Gregory Rodriguez为《国家移民论坛》撰写文章，他在报道中指出，如今移民既没有创新高，也不拒绝被同化，1998年移民占美国人口总数的9.8%，而1990年移民人口所占比例是13.6%。现在要考虑一下同化的三个指数：语言，住房所有权和通婚。
    1990年的人口普查表明“绝大多数移民在美国居住10年后英语说得得好或很好，他们来自15个最常移民的国家。”而这些移民的孩子往往会说双语，精通英语。“到了第三代，大多数移民家庭都不会说他们的本国语了。”因而美国被描述为语言的墓地。到1996年，那些在外国出生，于1970年前移民美国的人拥有的房屋的比例达到75.6%，高于土生土长的美国人的房屋拥有比例，后者为69.8%。
    在外国出生的亚洲人和西班牙人比土生土长的美国白人和黑人通婚比例高。到了第三代，三分之一的西班牙裔女性嫁给非西班牙裔男士，而41%的亚裔美国女性嫁给非亚裔人士。
    Rogriguez注意到，世界各地住在偏远村庄中的孩子是诸如阿诺德?斯瓦辛格和加思?布鲁克斯这类超级巨星的影迷。但是一些美国人担心住在美国的一些移民却不知为何没有受到该过同化作用的影响。
    美国存在分裂问题和骚动吗？没错。国家大了，就会什么东西都会有点儿。但是，当审视美国骚动的过去时，今天的各项社会指标还不能表明社会环境变得腐败黑暗。

文章解析：根据中心统一原则确定，
文章首段主题句是Stratford-on-Avon, as we all know, has only one industry－William Shakespeare－but there are two distinctly separate and increasingly hostile branches. 正如我们所知的那样，Stratford-on-Avon只有一个产业，就是威廉莎士比亚。但是在那儿有两个完全独立，敌意渐浓的分支机构。
第二段确定段落内容方向的语句是The worthy residents of Stratford doubt that the theatre adds a penny to their revenue. Stratford-on-Avon可敬的居民怀疑剧院是否给他们带来任何税收
第三段确定段落内容方向的语句是However, the playgoers do manage a little sight-seeing along with their playgoing. 但是，常看戏的人在看戏同时的确会观光一些地方。
第四段确定段落内容方向的语句是The townsfolk don’t see it this way and local council does not contribute directly to the subsidy of the Royal Shakespeare Company. 但该镇居民却不认可这种观点，地方议政厅并不直接给皇家莎士比亚公司拨款。
第五段确定段落内容方向的语句是Anyway, the townsfolk can’t understand why the Royal Shakespeare Company needs a subsidy. 无论怎样，该镇居民不能理解皇家莎士比亚公司为什么需要拨款。
第六段确定段落内容方向的语句是It would be a shame to raise prices too much because it would drive away the young people who are Stratford’s most attractive clientele. 将票价大幅度提高很可惜，因为这会将那些对Stratford最值得拥有的年轻客户赶跑。
不难发现，这篇文章围绕着埃文河盘的斯特拉特福镇的唯一产业---威廉.莎士比亚：皇家莎士比亚公司和该镇居民之间的问题来展开。

26. 【答案】[A] 
【解析】推断题.该题目作为推断题，要明确找到指定的前两个段落的主题句。根据“主题句---细节句原则”，第一段段落中间句没有转折词，段落首句Stratford-on-Avon, as we all know, has only one industry－William Shakespeare－but there are two distinctly separate and increasingly hostile branches.“正如我们所知的那样，Stratford-on-Avon只有一个产业，就是威廉莎士比亚。但是在那儿有两个完全独立，敌意渐浓的分支机构。”和第二段段首句The worthy residents of Stratford doubt that the theatre adds a penny to their revenue.“Stratford-on-Avon可敬的居民怀疑剧院是否给他们带来任何税收。” 选项A. the townsfolk deny the RSC ’ s contribution to the town’s revenue.居民们否定皇家莎士比亚公司对该镇的税收做出贡献，与相关信息句动作“只有一个产业，就是威廉莎士比亚；但是在那儿有两个完全独立，敌意渐浓的分支机构；居民怀疑剧院是否给他们带来任何税收”直接关联，动作“否定皇家莎士比亚公司对该镇的税收做出贡献”对应于“怀疑剧院是否给他们带来任何税收”，体现同意替换关系；选项B. the actors of the RSC imitate Shakespeare on and off stage.皇家莎士比亚公司的演员们台上台下都模仿莎士比亚，与相关信息句动作“只有一个产业，就是威廉莎士比亚；但是在那儿有两个完全独立，敌意渐浓的分支机构；居民怀疑剧院是否给他们带来任何税收”没有任何关联；选项C. the two branches of the RSC are not on good terms.皇家莎士比亚公司的两个分支机构相处不够融洽，与相关信息句动作“Stratford-on-Avon只有一个产业，就是威廉莎士比亚；但是在那儿有两个完全独立，敌意渐浓的分支机构；居民怀疑剧院是否给他们带来任何税收”似乎有关联，但是选项中的“the two branches of the RSC皇家莎士比亚公司的两个分支机构”与相关信息句中的“Stratford-on-Avon有两个完全独立，敌意渐浓的分支机构”相悖，这种命题陷阱称为“瞒天过海”；选项D. the townsfolk earn little from tourism.居民在旅游业中收益很少，与相关信息句动作“只有一个产业，就是威廉莎士比亚；但是在那儿有两个完全独立，敌意渐浓的分支机构；居民怀疑剧院是否给他们带来任何税收”没有任何关联。综上所述，可以确定答案为A. the townsfolk deny the RSC ’ s contribution to the town’s revenue.居民们否定皇家莎士比亚公司对该镇的税收做出贡献。
27. 【答案】[B] 
【解析】推断题.该题目作为推断题，要明确找到指定的第三段的主题句。根据“主题句---细节句原则”，第三段The tourist streams are not entirely separate. The sightseers who come by bus－and often take in Warwick Castle and Blenheim Palace on the side－don’t usually see the plays, and some of them are even surprised to find a theatre in Stratford. However, the playgoers do manage a little sight-seeing along with their playgoing. It is the playgoers, the RSC contends, who bring in much of the town’s revenue because they spend the night (some of them four or five nights) pouring cash into the hotels and restaurants. The sightseers can take in everything and get out of town by nightfall. 从段中的主题句The playgoers do manage a little sight-seeing along with their playgoing可以看出，D. the playgoers go to no other places in town than the theater.看戏的人除了去剧院之外不会去任何其他地方，不符合题意。[A]和[C]两项内容并未在本段提及。本段倒数第二句It is the playgoers, …pouring cash into the hotels and restaurants明确地揭示了正确答案为B. the playgoers spend more money than the sightseers.看戏的人比观光客花钱要多。
28. 【答案】[C] 
【解析】识词题.该题将识别的短语“Stratford cries poor traditionally”在文章中定位到第四段The townsfolk don’t see it this way and local council does not contribute directly to the subsidy of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Stratford cries poor traditionally. Nevertheless every hotel in town seems to be adding a new wing or cocktail lounge. Hilton is building its own hotel there, which you may be sure will be decorated with Hamlet Hamburger Bars, the Lear Lounge, the Banquo Banqueting Room, and so forth, and will be very expensive. 作为识词题，按照“方位论原则”：在识别词汇后面找表示“解释说明，逻辑关系”的表达，或者向前面找平行结构。在词汇后面出现“Nevertheless”，表达的是转折关系，因此相关信息句为Nevertheless every hotel in town seems to be adding a new wing or cocktail lounge. Hilton is building its own hotel there, which you may be sure will be decorated with Hamlet Hamburger Bars, the Lear Lounge, the Banquo Banqueting Room, and so forth, and will be very expensive.但是该镇的每一家宾馆似乎都在加添一个侧厅或鸡尾酒大厅。希尔顿正在那儿建自己的饭店，可想而知那里会有一个哈姆雷特汉堡酒吧，班柯宴会厅等等，价格将十分昂贵。从中不难看出，Stratford并非真的陷入财政困难。选项A. Stratford cannot afford the expansion projects.Stratford承担不起扩建计划，与相关信息句动作“加添一个侧厅或鸡尾酒大厅。希尔顿正在那儿建自己的饭店，会有一个哈姆雷特汉堡酒吧，班柯宴会厅等等，价格将十分昂贵”完全相悖；选项B. Stratford has long been in financial difficulties.Stratford长期以来一直陷入财务困难，与相关信息句动作“加添一个侧厅或鸡尾酒大厅。希尔顿正在那儿建自己的饭店，会有一个哈姆雷特汉堡酒吧，班柯宴会厅等等，价格将十分昂贵”完全相悖；选项C. the town is not really short of money.该镇并不是真的资金短缺，与相关信息句动作“加添一个侧厅或鸡尾酒大厅。希尔顿正在那儿建自己的饭店，会有一个哈姆雷特汉堡酒吧，班柯宴会厅等等，价格将十分昂贵”直接关联，体现“同意替换”的关系；选项D. the townsfolk used to be poorly paid.该镇居民过去收入很低，与相关信息句动作“加添一个侧厅或鸡尾酒大厅。希尔顿正在那儿建自己的饭店，会有一个哈姆雷特汉堡酒吧，班柯宴会厅等等，价格将十分昂贵”没有任何关联。因此，正确答案为C。
29. 【答案】[D] 
【解析】细节题.该题利用定位词“RSC”和“subsidy”定位到文章第五段Anyway, the townsfolk can’t understand why the RSC needs a subsidy. (The theatre has broken attendance records for three years in a row. Last year its 1,431 seats were 94 percent occupied all year long and this year they’ll do better.) “无论怎样，该镇居民不能理解皇家莎士比亚公司为什么需要拨款。（该剧院已经连续三年打破上座记录。去年，该剧院1431个座位的全年上座率为94%，今年将更高。）” 选项A. ticket prices can be raised to cover the spending. 可以提高票价来弥补支出，与相关信息句动作“不能理解皇家莎士比亚公司为什么需要拨款（该剧院已经连续三年打破上座记录）”没有任何关联；选项B. the company is financially ill-managed. 公司财政管理混乱，与相关信息句动作“不能理解皇家莎士比亚公司为什么需要拨款（该剧院已经连续三年打破上座记录）”没有任何关联；选项C. the behavior of the actors is not socially acceptable.演员的行为不被社会所接受，与相关信息句动作“不能理解皇家莎士比亚公司为什么需要拨款（该剧院已经连续三年打破上座记录）”没有任何关联；选项D. the theatre attendance is on the rise. 看戏的人数量在增加，与相关信息句动作“不能理解皇家莎士比亚公司为什么需要拨款（该剧院已经连续三年打破上座记录）”直接关联，体现“同意替换”的关系。因此，正确答案为D. the theatre attendance is on the rise.看戏的人数量在增加。
30. 【答案】[D] 
【解析】推断题.该题目作为推断题，要明确找到指定的第六段的主题句。根据“主题句---细节句原则”，第六段 It would be a shame to raise prices too much because it would drive away the young people who are Stratford’s most attractive clientele. They come entirely for the plays, not the sights. They all seem to look alike (though they come from all over)－lean, pointed, dedicated faces, wearing jeans and sandals, eating their buns and bedding down for the night on the flagstones outside the theatre to buy the 20 seats and 80 standing-room tickets held for the sleepers and sold to them when the box office opens at 10:30 a.m. 段落中间没有转折词，因此段落的主题句为段首句It would be a shame to raise prices too much because it would drive away the young people who are Stratford’s most attractive clientele. “将票价大幅度提高很可惜，因为这会将那些对Stratford最值得拥有的年轻客户赶跑。”shame一词体现了作者的感情色彩。因此，正确答案为D. is sympathetic to the RSC.对RSC感到同情。
全文翻译正如我们所知的那样，埃文河畔的斯特拉特福只有一个产业，那就是威廉?莎士比亚，但是那儿有两个完全独立的、敌意渐浓的分支机构。一个是皇家莎士比亚公司，它在该镇莎士比亚纪念剧院上演莎翁最好的戏剧作品。另一个是该镇居民，他们在很大程度上靠从来这儿的游客那儿赚钱为生，这些游客来这儿不是为了看戏剧，而是为了看ANNE Hathaway的小屋，莎翁的出生地和其他景点。
    斯特拉特福镇可敬的居民怀疑剧院是否给他们带来任何税收。他们坦然承认自己不喜欢RSC公司的演员，那些人留着长发，蓄着胡须，穿着便鞋，吵吵闹闹。想一想他们赖以为生的莎士比亚本人也是位演员（留着胡须），也制造噪音，就具有绝妙的讽刺意味。
    游客并未完全分流。乘公交车而来的观光者通常会参观离这儿不远的沃里克城堡（Warwick Castle）和布伦海姆宫（Blenheim Palace）。他们通常不会去看戏，一些人在斯特拉特福看到剧院甚至会感到惊异。但是，常看戏的人在看戏同时的确会观光一些地方。皇家莎士比亚公司辩称，正是那些看戏的人为城镇带来大部分税收，这是因为他们在该镇过夜（有些人会呆四五个晚上），在宾馆和餐厅消费。观光客在夜幕降临之前就能看完所有景点，离开城镇。
    但该镇居民却不认可这种观点，地方议政厅并不直接给皇家莎士比亚公司拨款。斯特拉特福一直在哭穷，但是该镇的每家宾馆似乎都在加添一个侧厅或鸡尾酒大厅。希尔顿正在那儿建自己的饭店，可想而知那里会有一个哈姆雷特汉堡酒吧、里尔休息厅、班柯宴会厅等等，价格将十分昂贵。
    不管怎样，该镇居民不能理解皇家莎士比亚公司为什么需要拨款。（该剧院已经连续三年打破了上座率记录。去年该剧院1431个座位的全年上座率达到94%，今年将更高。）当然，原因是成本增加，而票价却很低。
    将票价大幅提高很可惜，因为这会将那些对斯特拉特福最值得拥有的年轻客户赶跑。他们来这儿纯粹是为了看戏，而不是观光。他们看起来很相似（尽管他们来自世界各地），脸都瘦瘦的，尖尖的，一脸热诚，穿着仔裤和便鞋，吃圆面包，晚上睡在剧院外面的石板上，在上午10点半售票口开放时买20张座位票和80张专对这些人出售的站席票。

题目解析：
31. 【答案】[C] 
【解析】结构题.该题将例子“The extinction of large prehistoric animal”定位到文章第一段When prehistoric man arrived in new parts of the world, something strange happened to the large animals. They suddenly became extinct. Smaller species survived. The large, slow-growing animals were easy game, and were quickly hunted to extinction. Now something similar could be happening in the oceans.” 例子从段落首句开始到倒数第二句结束。根据结构题方位论原则，找例子对应的论点句。因此，例子后面相邻的句子Now something similar could be happening in the oceans.“现在类似现象（大型动物灭绝）可能正在海洋中发生。”是论点。选项A. large animals were vulnerable to the changing environment.大型海洋动物面对环境变化很脆弱，与相关信息句动作“现在类似现象（大型动物灭绝）可能正在海洋中发生”没有任何关联；选项B. small species survived as large animals disappeared.由于大型动物消失所以小型动物存活下来，与相关信息句动作“现在类似现象（大型动物灭绝）可能正在海洋中发生”没有任何关联；选项C. large sea animals may face the same threat today.大型海洋动物可能面对相同的威胁，与相关信息句动作“现在类似现象（大型动物灭绝）可能正在海洋中发生”直接关联，动作“大型海洋动物面对相同的威胁”对应于“类似现象可能正在海洋中发生”，体现“同意替换”的关系；选项D. Slow-growing fish outlive fast-growing ones.生长慢的鱼类生存时间比生长快的长，与相关信息句动作““现在类似现象（大型动物灭绝）可能正在海洋中发生”没有任何关联。因此，正确答案为C. large sea animals may face the same threat today.大型海洋动物可能面对相同的威胁。
32. 【答案】[A] 
【解析】细节题.该题利用定位词“Dr Myers and Dr. Worm’s paper”粗略定位到文章第二段What researchers such as Ransom Myers and Boris Worm have shown is just how fast things are changing. They have looked at half a century of data from fisheries around the world. Their methods do not attempt to estimate the actual biomass (the amount of living biological matter) of fish species in particular parts of the ocean, but rather changes in that biomass over time.利用“paper”准确定位到段落的句子According to their latest paper published in Nature, the biomass of large predators (animals that kill and eat other animals) in a new fishery is reduced on average by 80% within 15 years of the start of exploitation. In some long-fished areas, it has halved again since then.“根据他们最近发表在《自然》中的论文，一个新的渔场中大型食肉鱼类的数量在开始开发海洋资源的15年间平均下降了80%，在一些旧的渔场，这15年来，大型食肉鱼类的数量在此基础上又减少了一半。”因此，正确答案为A. the stock of large predators in some old fisheries has reduced by 90%.有些老渔场大型动物的存活量已经减少了90%。
33．【答案】[C] 
【解析】识词题.该题将识别的短语“these figures are conservative”在文章中定位到第三段Dr Worm acknowledges that the figures are conservative. One reason for this is that fishing technology has improved. Today's vessels can find their prey using satellites and sonar, which were not available 50 years ago. That means a higher proportion of what is in the sea is being caught, so the real difference between present and past is likely to be worse than the one recorded by changes in catch sizes. 作为识词题，按照“方位论原则”：在识别词汇后面找表示“解释说明，逻辑关系”的表达，或者向前面找平行结构。在词汇后面出现“That means”，表示解释说明关系相关信息句为That means a higher proportion of what is in the sea is being caught, so the real difference between present and past is likely to be worse than the one recorded by changes in catch sizes. “这意味着更多的海洋生物被捕获，因此现在和过去的渔业情况的真实差距可能比记录下来的捕获量的变化还要大。” 选项A. fishing technology has improved rapidly. 捕鱼技术发展很迅速，与相关信息句动作“意味着更多的海洋生物被捕获，因此现在和过去的渔业情况的真实差距可能比记录下来的捕获量的变化还要大”没有任何关联；选项B. the catch-sizes are actually smaller then recorded. 实际上捕鱼量比记录的要少，与相关信息句动作“意味着更多的海洋生物被捕获，因此现在和过去的渔业情况的真实差距可能比记录下来的捕获量的变化还要大”恰恰相反；选项C. the marine biomass has suffered a greater loss.海洋生物群遭受了严重的损失，与相关信息句动作“意味着更多的海洋生物被捕获，因此现在和过去的渔业情况的真实差距可能比记录下来的捕获量的变化还要大”没有任何关联；选项D. the data collected so far are out of date.目前收集的数据过时了，与相关信息句动作“意味着更多的海洋生物被捕获，因此现在和过去的渔业情况的真实差距可能比记录下来的捕获量的变化还要大”直接关联，动作“目前收集的数据过时了”对应于“现在和过去的渔业情况的真实差距可能比记录下来的捕获量的变化还要大”。因此，答案应选D. the data collected so far are out of date.目前收集的数据过时了。
34. 【答案】[D] 
【解析】细节题.该题利用定位词“Dr Myers and other researchers”定位到文章第四段Dr Myers and Dr Worm argue that their work gives a correct baseline, which future management efforts must take into account. “Myers博士和Worm博士指出，他们的工作确定了一个正确的基准，未来的海洋管理必须将其考虑在内。” 选项A. people should look for a baseline that can work for a longer time.人们应该寻找一个能适用较长时间的基准，与文中定位语句的动作“确定了一个正确的基准，未来的海洋管理必须将其考虑在内”没有任何关联；选项B. fisheries should keep the yield below 50% of the biomass.渔场应该将捕鱼量控制在存活量的50%以下，与文中定位语句的动作“确定了一个正确的基准，未来的海洋管理必须将其考虑在内”没有任何关联；选项C. the ocean biomass should restored its original level.海洋生物群落应该恢复到原来的水平，与文中定位语句的动作“确定了一个正确的基准，未来的海洋管理必须将其考虑在内”没有任何关联；选项D. people should adjust the fishing baseline to changing situations.人们应该调整捕鱼的基准以适应时时变化的条件，与文中定位语句的动作“确定了一个正确的基准，未来的海洋管理必须将其考虑在内”没有任何关联。可见，定位词定位的语句不能确定唯一正确的答案。作为细节题，要向下一句一句逐一与选项比较，知道最终确定答案。后面语句叙述到They believe the data support an idea current among marine biologists, that of the "shifting baseline". “他们相信这些数据能够支持目前海洋生物学家认可的观点：改变基准。” 选项A. people should look for a baseline that can work for a longer time.人们应该寻找一个能适用较长时间的基准，与相关信息句动作“相信这些数据能够支持目前海洋生物学家认可的观点：改变基准”没有直接关联；选项B. fisheries should keep the yield below 50% of the biomass.渔场应该将捕鱼量控制在存活量的50%以下，与相关信息句动作“相信这些数据能够支持目前海洋生物学家认可的观点：改变基准”没有任何关联；选项C. the ocean biomass should restored its original level.海洋生物群落应该恢复到原来的水平，与相关信息句动作“相信这些数据能够支持目前海洋生物学家认可的观点：改变基准”没有直接关联；选项D. people should adjust the fishing baseline to changing situations.人们应该调整捕鱼的基准以适应时时变化的条件，与相关信息句动作“相信这些数据能够支持目前海洋生物学家认可的观点：改变基准”直接关联，动作“调整捕鱼基准适应变化的条件”对应于“改变基准”，体现“同意替换”的关系。因此，正确答案为D. people should adjust the fishing baseline to changing situations. 人们应该调整捕鱼的基准以适应时时变化的条件。
35. 【答案】[B] 
【解析】细节题.该题利用定位词“mainly”粗略定位到文章第四段That matters because theory suggests that the maximum sustainable yield that can be cropped from a fishery comes when the biomass of a target species is about 50% of its original levels. Most fisheries are well below that, which is a bad way to do business. “这很重要，因为理论表明当这一目标物种生物群落的数量是原来的50%时，人们能够从渔业得到的最大的可持续性的产出。但大多数渔场的数量低于50%这种做生意的方式很糟糕。”显然，生物群落的数量和水平决定了从事该行业人的收入。因此，正确答案为B. biomass level生物群落水平。
全文翻译当史前人类来到地球新的地域时，大型动物发生了一些奇怪的事情，他们突然之间灭绝了，小一点儿的物种得以存活。那些大型的、生长缓慢的动物比较容易猎取，由于被猎杀而迅速灭绝。现在类似的情况可能正在海洋中发生。
    人们知道海洋中的鱼类过量捕捞已经有些年了。Ransom Myers和Boris worm这些研究人员只是让我们知道了事情变化得多快。他们查询了来自世界各地渔场的50年的数据，目的并非去估算在海洋中的某些特定部分的鱼类的实际数量，而是不同时间内鱼类数量的改变。根据他们发表在《自然》期刊上的最新论文，一个新的渔场中的大型食肉鱼渔类的数量在开始开发海洋资源的15年间平均下降了80%，在一些旧的渔场，这15年来，大型食肉鱼类的数量在此基础上又减少了一半。
    Worm博士生成这些数字比较保守。一个原因是捕鱼技术有所改进。如今，船只可以借助卫星和声纳定位仪发现猎物，这在50年前无法作到。这意味着更多的海洋生物被捕获，因此现在和过去渔业情况的真实差距可能比记录下来的捕获量的变化还要大。此外，在早些年，多钩长线上可能会挂满更多的鱼，但是因为没有挂了鱼饵的鱼钩来诱惑它们了，所以一些鱼就没被捕到，这就造成了对过去海洋中的鱼类数量估计不足。而且，在早期用多钩长线钓鱼时，许多鱼在上钩后被鲨鱼吃掉了。现在这不成问题了，因为现在鲨鱼数量少了。
    Myers博士和Worm博士指出，他们的工作确定了一个正确的基准，未来的（海洋）管理必须将其考虑进去。他们相信这些数据能够支持目前海洋生物学家认可的观点：改变基准。这一观点指出人们没有察觉发生在海洋中的巨大变化是因为他们在审视与现在做对比的过去时，用来衡量这个变化的时间段相对较短。这很重要，因为理论表明当某一目标物种的数量是原来的50%时，人们能够从渔业得到最大的可持续性的产出。但大多数渔场的数量低于原来的50%，这种做生意方式很糟糕。

不难发现，这篇文章围绕着人的负面情感问题来展开。
36．【答案】[D] 
【解析】结构题.该题将例子“Wordsworth and Baudelaire”定位到文章第二段This wasn't always so. The earliest forms of art, like painting and music, are those best suited for expressing joy. But somewhere in the 19th century, more artists began seeing happiness as meaningless, phony or, worst of all, boring as we went from Wordsworth's daffodils to Baudelaire's flowers of evil. 根据结构题方位论原则，找例子对应的论点句。例子前面相邻的句子The earliest forms of art, like painting and music, are those best suited for expressing joy.“诸如绘画和音乐这样的早期艺术形式最适合表达快乐。”也同样是例子。因此，段落首句This wasn't always so.“但情况并不总是这样的。”为论点。但是，该句由于代词“this”表达的含义不完整，所以要找到“this”的指代，即前一段落的尾句But the weirdest may be this: artists' only job is to explore emotions, and yet they choose to focus on the ones that feel bad. “最怪异的事情是艺术家唯一的工作是探索情感，并且选择关注那些负面情感。” 选项A. poetry is not as expressive of joy as painting or music.在表达快乐时，诗歌的表现力不如绘画和音乐，与相关信息句动作“最怪异的事情是艺术家唯一的工作是探索情感，并且选择关注那些负面情感”没有任何关联；选项B. art grows out of both positive and negative feeling.艺术来自正面和负面的情感，与相关信息句动作“最怪异的事情是艺术家唯一的工作是探索情感，并且选择关注那些负面情感”没有任何关联；选项C. poets today are less skeptical of happiness.如今的诗人对于幸福少了些怀疑，与相关信息句动作“最怪异的事情是艺术家唯一的工作是探索情感，并且选择关注那些负面情感”没有任何关联；选项D. artists have changed their focus of interest.艺术家的关注点发生了变化，与相关信息句动作“最怪异的事情是艺术家唯一的工作是探索情感，并且选择关注那些负面情感”相关联，动作“艺术家的关注点发生了变化”对应于“艺术家唯一的工作是探索情感，并且选择关注那些负面情感”，体现了“包含与被包含”的关系。综上所述，正确答案为D. artists have changed their focus of interest.艺术家的关注点发生了变化。
37. 【答案】[B] 
【解析】识词题.该题将识别的词汇“bummer”在文章中定位到第五段People in earlier eras were surrounded by reminders of misery. They worked until exhausted, lived with few protections and died young. In the West, before mass communication and literacy, the most powerful mass medium was the church, which reminded worshippers that their souls were in danger and that they would someday be meat for worms. Given all this, they did not exactly need their art to be a bummer too. 作为识词题，按照“方位论原则”：在识别词汇后面找表示“解释说明，逻辑关系”的表达，或者向前面找平行结构。在词汇后面出现“too”，表示并列关系，因此相关信息句为In the West, before mass communication and literacy, the most powerful mass medium was the church, which reminded worshippers that their souls were in danger and that they would someday be meat for worms. “在西方，在大众传播开始出现，人们开始读书识字之前，最强势的大众传媒是教堂，他提醒那些礼拜者他们的心灵处于危险之中，有一天可能会受到蠕虫的啃噬。”句子中“心灵处于危险之中，可能会受到蠕虫的啃噬”表现出一种消极不快的情绪和状态。因此，答案应选B. unpleasant不快的。 
38. 【答案】[D] 
【解析】细节题.该题利用定位词“advertising”定位到文章第四段After all, what is the one modern form of expression almost completely dedicated to depicting happiness? Advertising. The rise of anti-happy art almost exactly tracks the emergence of mass media, and with it, a commercial culture in which happiness is not just an ideal but an ideology.“宣扬不幸的艺术的出现几乎完全是紧随大众媒体的出现而来，随大众媒体而来的是一种广告文化，在这种文化中，幸福不仅仅是理想，而是意识形态。” 选项A. emerges in the wake of the anti-happy art. 广告随着宣扬不幸的艺术觉醒而出现，与相关信息句动作“宣扬不幸的艺术的出现几乎完全是紧随大众媒体的出现而来，随大众媒体而来的是一种广告文化，在这种文化中，幸福不仅仅是理想，还是意识形态”似乎相关联，但是选项中“广告随着宣扬不幸的艺术觉醒而出现”与相关信息句中的“宣扬不幸的艺术的出现几乎完全是紧随大众媒体的出现而来”相悖；选项B. is a cause of disappointment for the general public. 广告是普通人失望的原因，与相关信息句动作“宣扬不幸的艺术的出现几乎完全是紧随大众媒体的出现而来，随大众媒体而来的是一种广告文化，在这种文化中，幸福不仅仅是理想，而是意识形态”没有任何关联；选项     C. replaces the church as a major source of information. 广告取代教堂成为主要的信息来源，与相关信息句动作“宣扬不幸的艺术的出现几乎完全是紧随大众媒体的出现而来，随大众媒体而来的是一种广告文化，在这种文化中，幸福不仅仅是理想，而是意识形态”没有任何关联；选项D. creates an illusion of happiness rather than happiness itself. 广告带来幸福的幻象而不是真正的幸福，与相关信息句动作“宣扬不幸的艺术的出现几乎完全是紧随大众媒体的出现而来，随大众媒体而来的是一种广告文化，在这种文化中，幸福不仅仅是理想，而是意识形态”相关联，动作“广告带来幸福的幻象而不是真正的幸福”对应于“在广告文化中，幸福不仅仅是理想，而是意识形态”，体现“同意替换”的关系。因此，正确答案为D. creates an illusion of happiness rather than happiness itself.带来幸福的幻象而不是真正的幸福。
39. 【答案】[B] 
【解析】推断题.该题目作为推断题，要明确找到指定的最后一段的主题句。根据“主题句---细节句原则”，第七段 What we forget---what our economy depends on us forgetting---is that happiness is more than pleasure without pain. The things that bring the greatest joy carry the greatest potential for loss and disappointment. Today, surrounded by promises of easy happiness, we need someone to tell us, as religion once did, Memento mori: remember that you will die, that everything ends, and that happiness comes not in denying this but in living with it. It's a message even more bitter than a clove cigarette, yet, somehow, a breath of fresh air. 段落中间没有转折词，段落首句What we forget---what our economy depends on us forgetting---is that happiness is more than pleasure without pain.“我们所忘记的（即我们的经济所依赖我们要遗忘的）是幸福，不仅仅是没有痛苦的快乐。”明确是细节。因此段落的主题句为段尾句It's a message even more bitter than a clove cigarette, yet, somehow, a breath of fresh air.“这个信息比丁香烟叶还苦，但是会以某种方式带来一股清新的气息。” 选项A. happiness more often than not ends in sadness. 幸福时常以悲伤终结，与相关信息句动作“比丁香烟叶还苦，但以某种方式带来一股清新的气息”相悖；选项B. the anti-happy art is distasteful but refreshing. 那些宣扬不幸的艺术令人不快，但是令人有新鲜之感，与相关信息句动作“比丁香烟叶还苦，但以某种方式带来一股清新的气息”相关联，动作“令人不快，但是令人有新鲜之感”对应于“比丁香烟叶还苦，但带来一股清新的气息”，体现“同意替换”的关系；选项C. misery should be enjoyed rather than denied.应该欣赏而不是否认不幸，与相关信息句动作“比丁香烟叶还苦，但以某种方式带来一股清新的气息”没有直接联系；选项D. the anti-happy art flourishes when economy booms. 宣扬不幸的艺术在经济繁荣时兴盛起来，与相关信息句动作“比丁香烟叶还苦，但以某种方式带来一股清新的气息”没有任何联系。因此，正确答案为B. the anti-happy art is distasteful but refreshing.那些宣扬不幸的艺术令人不快但是令人有新鲜之感。
40. 【答案】[A] 
【解析】推断题.在第五段谈论reminders of misery（痛苦的提醒者）话题时，作者说：the church…reminded worshippers that their souls were in danger and that they would someday be meat for worms（教会提醒朝拜者，他们的灵魂处于危险之中，他们的躯体将成为蠕虫的美食）。在第七段，作者把反幸福艺术的警示作用与宗教的提醒作用等同起来（…we need art to tell us, as religion once did…）。选项A. Religion once functioned as a reminder of misery.宗教曾经发挥提醒人们不幸的功能。这与题意完全相符。（补充：这种提问方式是推断题。按照推断题方位论原则，对应段落的主题句是相关信息句。但是，间或会出现对应段落的主题句与选项没有任何关联，不能确定答案的情况。这种题目就只能利用四个选项分别回归文章定位，通篇考虑，逐一比较才能够确定答案。由于这种题目仅仅考察信息的对应，没有涉及分析理解能力的水平，所以不是考研英语试题中的重点试题。）
全文翻译有许多事情让人们认为艺术家很怪异，而最怪异的事情是艺术家的唯一工作是探索感情，并且选择关注那些负面感情。
    但情况并不总是这样的。诸如绘画和音乐这样的早期艺术形式最适合表达快乐。但是大约在19世纪，从英国诗人华兹华斯的水仙花到法国诗人波德莱尔的恶之花，更多的艺术家开始认为快乐是无意义的，虚伪的，甚至是快乐让人感到厌烦。
    你可能会辩解，艺术对幸福更为怀疑这是因为现代社会目睹了这样的不幸。但是这并非是说在早些时候就没有没完没了的战争，灾难及对无辜者的屠杀。事实上，可能恰恰相反，（艺术对幸福更为怀疑的）原因是如今这个世界有了太多该死的幸福。
    最终，什么是一种几乎能够完全致力于描绘幸福的现代表达方式呢？广告。宣扬不幸的艺术的出现几乎完全是紧随大众媒体的出现而来，随大众媒体而来的是一种广告文化，在这种文化中，幸福不仅仅是理想，还是意识形态。
    早期的人民被不幸包围。他们一直工作，直到累的筋疲力尽，生活几无保障，年纪轻轻就命丧黄泉。在西方，在大众传播开始出现，人们开始读书识字之前，最强势的大众媒体是教堂，它可以提醒那些礼拜者他们的心灵处于危险之中，有一天可能会受到蠕虫的啃噬。考虑到这些，人们也确实不需要让艺术也变成让人不快的东西了。
    如今，普通西方人不断接收的并非宗教信息，而是商业信息及永远快乐的信息。食用快餐者，新闻主播，通信员们，所有人的人都在微笑、微笑、不停地微笑。我们的杂志上以容光焕发的名字和住在漂亮房子里的幸福家庭做特写。因为这些信息有秘密目的――诱使我们打开钱包，这让幸福的感觉看起来不可信。在我们发现治疗关节炎的药物Celebrex可能增加患心脏病的风险之前，有关该药物的广告让我们为它的诞生而庆祝。
    我们所忘记的（也及我们的经济所依赖我们要遗忘的）是幸福不仅仅是没有痛苦的快乐。那些能够带来巨大快乐的东西也会有可能带来巨大的损失和失望。如今，我们周围到处都是唾手可得的幸福的承诺，我们需要有人像过去宗教所做的那样告诉我们“无常”的象征，即记主要你会死去，一切都会消亡，记住幸福不是否认这些，而是与这些共存。这个信息比丁香烟叶还苦，但是会以某种方式带来一股清新气息。

【解析】空格前一段谈到：William的一个朋友帮助他进入一家戒赌中心，并把William的问题通知给赌场；赌场发回来一封禁赌信，并说，William必须提供医学或心理方面的证据证明他进入赌场不会对他的身体健康造成损害，否则，赌场不会再准许他去赌博。后一段的大意是：《华尔街日报》报道了赌场的24条声明，比如“以赌为乐……不要过火”；每张门票上都留有心理咨询的免费电话；然而，明知他赌博成瘾，赌场还故意诱惑他“做违背自己意愿的事情”。空格中应涉及赌场重又引诱William去赌博的内容。选项[A]大意为：赌场继续以强大的攻势诱使William进入赌场，而并没有人察觉他是“禁赌人员”。[A]与上下文完全符合，因此是正确答案。
43．【答案】[B]
【解析】空格后一段大意为：一份精神障碍方面的专业杂志说，“病态的赌博”是指持续地、复发性地、不可控制地追求突发横财带来的刺激，而不是追求金钱本身。这显然是在分析“病态的赌博”的症状。而上一段谈到赌场诱使William进入赌场，“做违背自己意愿的事情”。选项[B]的意思是：并不清楚究竟是什么在引诱他；从何种意义来说，他的意愿才算不被强制？此项正好符合上下文逻辑。另外，上文最后一句中的lure一词与[B]项中luring相互照应。因此，[B]是答案。
44．【答案】[F]
【解析】由于本题空格是在段首，因此空格内容与后文关系更为密切。后一句的大意是：在科学或所谓科学的推动下，社会正把曾经认为的性格缺陷或道德缺点重新归类为与身体残疾相似的个性障碍。选项[F]的大意是：令人担忧的是，社会正在用药物处理越来越多的行为问题，并把意志力薄弱定义为“毒”瘾发作。这两句的结构与内涵非常相似，因此应选[F]为答案。
45．【答案】[D]
【解析】空格后文说到：44个州有彩票，29个州有赌场，大多数州都不同程度地依赖着赌博业带来的税收。这显然是一种政府行为。涉及政府行为的有[D]和[G]两个选项，而[G]讲的是本文最后才提到的网络赌博，只有[D]符合题意。
参考译文
    Evansville镇坐落在印第安纳州俄亥俄河的北岸，是52岁的大卫?威廉姆斯的家乡，镇上有一家内河船赌场。威廉姆斯是州政府的一名审计员，年薪35，000美元。在那家赌场赌了几年，他大约输了175000美元。以前他从未参与赌博，直到有一天，那家赌场送他一张价值20美元的赌博优惠券。
    他去了那家赌场，输了20美元，然后离开了。第二次去赌场他输了800美元。作为一名优秀顾客，赌场发给他一张“娱乐卡”，赌场里使用可以获得积分，换取食物和饮料，赌场也可以以此来追踪使用者的赌博活动。对于威廉姆斯而言，这些活动成为他所谓的“电子海洛因”。
    在他输了5，000美元的时候，他对自己说如果能捞回本钱，他就会停手。有一天晚上他赢了5，500美元，但是他并未停手。在1997年，他玩投币赌博游戏时两天时间内输了21，000美元。1997年三月间，他输了72，186美元。有时候，他同时玩两台投币机，整晚整晚地玩，直到凌晨5点赌船进港关门为止，在赌场没有禁止他光顾，原因是赌场知道他沉溺其中不能自拔。赌场的确知道他有问题。
    1998年三月，威廉姆斯在一个朋友在他不情愿的情况下将他送入治疗中心，戒除赌瘾，并写信告知赌场威廉姆斯上瘾的事实。赌场将威廉姆斯的照片放入被禁止赌博的赌徒名单中，给他写了一封“禁止进入赌场”的信。注明了赌博行为的医学/心理学特征，信中指出在允许他重新进入赌场之前，威廉姆斯必须提供证明他光临赌场不会对他的安全和生活幸福造成危害。
    尽管他没有提供这些证明，赌场的市场部还是不断地给他寄资料。他进入赌场，使用“娱乐卡”，而赌场并未察觉。
    据《华尔街周刊》报道，该赌场有24个警告牌，写着诸如“享受乐趣，用头脑赌博，不要头脑发热”一类的警告语。每张入场卷上都印着一个免费电话号码，可以向印地安纳州心理健康部门进行咨询。然而，威廉姆斯的诉状指出赌场明明知道他无可救要地沉溺与赌博，却故意引诱他做出违背自己意愿的行为。
    考虑到他强迫性的行为，赌场是否故意引诱他还不得而知，而他的意愿又体现在那些方面呢？
    第四版《心理紊乱诊断数据手册》指出，病态赌博指的是在追求意外横财时，持续地、反复地、无法自控地寻求冒险刺激，并非仅仅为了钱。
    令人不安的是，现在社会越来越多地用医学方法处理行为问题，以前严厉的前辈们称之为意志薄弱的行为现在被认为是上瘾。由于科学或所谓科学的推动，社会正在对行为问题进行重新分类，把从前认为是性格缺陷、道德过失的重新归类到类似于胜利障碍的病态人格。
    赌博一直是美国人生活中的普遍现象。长期以来，人们认为赌博是一种罪过或者是一种社会疾病。现在赌博却成为一种社会政策：在美国，最主要、最有力的赌博推动者是美国政府。
    四十四个州发行彩票，29个州设有赌场，而这些州中大多数在不同程度上倚赖于（你可能会说沉溺于）来自赌博的税收。自从1995年建立了第一个赌博网站以来，争夺赌徒资金的竞争加剧。据10月28日那期《新闻周刊》的报道，200万赌徒每周光顾1800个虚拟赌场。今年网络赌徒们输掉的钱达到35亿美元，赌博业已经超越色情业，成为网络上最赢利的行业。

    美国知识分子受到排斥，人们认为他们在社会中无关紧要，确实如此吗？这里指出的是情况并非那样。Father Bruchbergen让我们了解到部分真实情况。他指出是美国受到知识分子的排斥。然而，知识分子所做的还不止这些，他们对知识分子所发挥的作用日益感到不满。正是他们自己，而不是美国，成了反知识分子者。
首先，我们要对研究对象进行定义。什么是知识分子？我将知识分子定义为这样的人。他把用苏格拉底的方法思考道德问题作为自己的主要责任和人生乐趣。他有意识地、清楚坦诚地探索这一问题，首先针对一些事实问题提问，然后针对道德问题提问，最后根据已经获得的事实和道德信息提出一些看似合理的建议，建议人们如何行动。他的职责与法官相似，必须承担这样的责任：用尽可能明了的方式来展示自己做出决定的推理过程。
 这一定义将许多通常被称为知识分子的人排除在外，那些普通科学家便是其中之一。我把普通科学家排除在外，是因为尽管他们的成就有助于解决道德问题，但却仅仅限于这些问题的事实方面，他们并未承担解决道德问题的任务。与其他人一样，他们会在完成自己的日常任务时遇到道德问题――他不应该伪造实验，捏造证据，修改实验报告。但是科学家的主要任务不是思考支配自己行为的道德准则，正如人们不会期待商人将精力投入到研究商业中的行为规范一样。普通科学家在大部分醒着的时日都会认为自己的道德准则理所当然，这和商人是一样的。
    这个定义也将绝大多数教师排除在外，尽管从传统意义上来说，多数知识分子的谋生手段是教书。这些教师可能擅长教书，而且不仅仅专注于赚钱，但大多数人很少或者没有对涉及道德判断的人类问题进行独立思考。这种情况也适用大多数杰出学者。在人类知识的某一领域学识渊博是一回事，而：“对社会进行卓越的思考”（爱默生语）则是另一回事。

Dear Sir or Madam,
As a college student who is studying and living in a good environment, I wish to contribute to Project Hope by offering financial assistance to a child in a remote area. Having conceived such a plan for a long time, I write this letter to request your help to recommend a proper candidate.
I wonder if it is convenient for you if three things concerning the child are taken into consideration. First, the child should come from Gansu Province, for I intend to help a child from my hometown. Second, it will be better if the child is a primary school student. I hope I will help him/her from the very beginning. In addition, he/she must be willing to return to his hometown to help built it after graduation from university.
My plan will be carried out as follows. On one hand, I will remit at least 2,000 Yuan in cash every year until he/she finishes his/her education before entering college. On the other hand, I decide to teach the child math and English in person during my summer vacation, which will surely be more beneficial to the child.
Your prompt help would be highly appreciated. And I am looking forward to your reply very soon.
Yours sincerely,
Li Ming

How ironic the two pictures are in describing one of the most widespread social phenomena concerning idol adoration! In the first picture, a young man writes the name of Beckham on his face. In the second picture, another young man spends 300 Yuan in dealing with his hair to make himself look like Beckham.
The meaning conveyed in the two pictures reveals that in current China some young people are losing themselves. I am greatly shocked by the enthusiasm for this British football superstar shown by these two young men. Frankly speaking, things of this kind really happen among us. Some people, especially college students, do nothing but concentrate on imitating superstars. This does great harm to their study and growth. If we can’t stop the worsening of this tendency, our own culture will be damaged, and we ourselves will be the ultimate victims.
From my point of view, a lot of measures should be taken to save our losing culture and re-find ourselves. In fact, some measures have already been taken. In my university, campaigns have been launched to educate people to pay more attention to our traditional culture and read more books instead of focusing on our appearances. As a result, we have witnessed some improvements but still there is a long way to go.

The human nose is an underrated tool. Humans are often thought to be insensitive smellers compared with animals, 大1家 this is largely because, 大2家 animals, we stand upright. This means that our noses are 大3家 to perceiving those smells which float through the air, 大4家 the majority of smells which stick to surfaces. In fact, 大5家, we are extremely sensitive to smells, 大6家 we do not generally realize it. Our noses are capable of 大7家 human smells even when these are 大8家 to far below one part in one million.
Strangely, some people find that they can smell one type of flower but not another, 大9家 others are sensitive to the smells of both flowers. This may be because some people do not have the genes necessary to generate 大10家 smell receptors in the nose. These receptors are the cells which sense smells and send 大11家 to the brain. However, it has been found that even people insensitive to a certain smell 大12家 can suddenly become sensitive to it when 大13家 to it often enough.
The explanation for insensitivity to smell seems to be that the brain finds it 大14家 to keep all smell receptors working all the time but can 大15家 new receptors if necessary. This may 大16家 explain why we are not usually sensitive to our own smells―we simply do not need to be. We are not 大17家 of the usual smell of our own house, but we 大18家 new smells when we visit someone else’s.

Text 1
Everybody loves a fat pay rise. Yet pleasure at your own can vanish if you learn that a colleague has been given a bigger one. Indeed, if he has a reputation for slacking, you might even be outraged. Such behaviour is regarded as “all too human,” with the underlying assumption that other animals would not be capable of this finely developed sense of grievance. But a study by Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, which has just been published in Nature, suggests that it is all too monkey, as well.
The researchers studied the behaviour of female brown capuchin monkeys. They look cute. They are good-natured, co-operative creatures, and they share their food readily. Above all, like their female human counterparts, they tend to pay much closer attention to the value of “goods and services” than males.
Such characteristics make them perfect candidates for Dr. Brosnan’s and Dr. de Waal’s study. The researchers spent two years teaching their monkeys to exchange tokens for food. Normally, the monkeys were happy enough to exchange pieces of rock for slices of cucumber. However, when two monkeys were placed in separate but adjoining chambers, so that each could observe what the other was getting in return for its rock, their behaviour became markedly different.
In the world of capuchins, grapes are luxury goods (and much preferable to cucumbers). So when one monkey was handed a grape in exchange for her token, the second was reluctant to hand hers over for a mere piece of cucumber. And if one received a grape without having to provide her token in exchange at all, the other either tossed her own token at the researcher or out of the chamber, or refused to accept the slice of cucumber. Indeed, the mere presence of a grape in the other chamber (without an actual monkey to eat it) was enough to induce resentment in a female capuchin.
The researchers suggest that capuchin monkeys, like humans, are guided by social emotions. In the wild, they are a co-operative, group-living species. Such co-operation is likely to be stable only when each animal feels it is not being cheated. Feelings of righteous indignation, it seems, are not the preserve of people alone. Refusing a lesser reward completely makes these feelings abundantly clear to other members of the group. However, whether such a sense of fairness evolved independently in capuchins and humans, or whether it stems from the common ancestor that the species had 35 million years ago, is, as yet, an unanswered question.
21.	In the opening paragraph, the author introduces his topic by ________.
[A] posing a contrast
[B] justifying an assumption
[C] making a comparison
[D] explaining a phenomenon
22.	The statement “it is all too monkey” (Last line, Paragraph l) implies that ________.
[A] monkeys are also outraged by slack rivals
[B] resenting unfairness is also monkeys’ nature
[C] monkeys, like humans, tend to be jealous of each other
[D] no animals other than monkeys can develop such emotions
23.	Female capuchin monkeys were chosen for the research most probably because they are ________.
[A] more inclined to weigh what they get
[B] attentive to researchers’ instructions
[C] nice in both appearance and temperament
[D] more generous than their male companions
24.	Dr. Brosnan and Dr. de Waal have eventually found in their study that the monkeys ________.
[A] prefer grapes to cucumbers
[B] can be taught to exchange things
[C] will not be co-operative if feeling cheated
[D] are unhappy when separated from others
25.	What can we infer from the last paragraph?
[A] Monkeys can be trained to develop social emotions.
[B] Human indignation evolved from an uncertain source.
[C] Animals usually show their feelings openly as humans do.
[D] Cooperation among monkeys remains stable only in the wild.
Text 2
Do you remember all those years when scientists argued that smoking would kill us but the doubters insisted that we didn’t know for sure? That the evidence was inconclusive, the science uncertain? That the antismoking lobby was out to destroy our way of life and the government should stay out of the way? Lots of Americans bought that nonsense, and over three decades, some 10 million smokers went to early graves.
There are upsetting parallels today, as scientists in one wave after another try to awaken us to the growing threat of global warming. The latest was a panel from the National Academy of Sciences, enlisted by the White House, to tell us that the Earth’s atmosphere is definitely warming and that the problem is largely man-made. The clear message is that we should get moving to protect ourselves. The president of the National Academy, Bruce Alberts, added this key point in the preface to the panel’s report: “Science never has all the answers. But science does provide us with the best available guide to the future, and it is critical that our nation and the world base important policies on the best judgments that science can provide concerning the future consequences of present actions.”
Just as on smoking, voices now come from many quarters insisting that the science about global warming is incomplete, that it’s OK to keep pouring fumes into the air until we know for sure. This is a dangerous game: by the time 100 percent of the evidence is in, it may be too late. With the risks obvious and growing, a prudent people would take out an insurance policy now.
Fortunately, the White House is starting to pay attention. But it’s obvious that a majority of the president’s advisers still don’t take global warming seriously. Instead of a plan of action, they continue to press for more research -- a classic case of “paralysis by analysis.”
To serve as responsible stewards of the planet, we must press forward on deeper atmospheric and oceanic research. But research alone is inadequate. If the Administration won’t take the legislative initiative, Congress should help to begin fashioning conservation measures. A bill by Democratic Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, which would offer financial incentives for private industry, is a promising start. Many see that the country is getting ready to build lots of new power plants to meet our energy needs. If we are ever going to protect the atmosphere, it is crucial that those new plants be environmentally sound.
26.	An argument made by supporters of smoking was that ________.
[A] there was no scientific evidence of the correlation between smoking and death
[B] the number of early deaths of smokers in the past decades was insignificant
[C] people had the freedom to choose their own way of life
[D] antismoking people were usually talking nonsense
27.	According to Bruce Alberts, science can serve as ________.
[A] a protector
[B] a judge
[C] a critic
[D] a guide
28.	What does the author mean by “paralysis by analysis” (Last line, Paragraph 4)?
[A] Endless studies kill action.
[B] Careful investigation reveals truth.
[C] Prudent planning hinders progress.
[D] Extensive research helps decision-making.

Of all the components of a good night’s sleep, dreams seem to be least within our control. In dreams, a window opens into a world where logic is suspended and dead people speak. A century ago, Freud formulated his revolutionary theory that dreams were the disguised shadows of our unconscious desires and fears; by the late 1970s, neurologists had switched to thinking of them as just “mental noise” -- the random byproducts of the neural-repair work that goes on during sleep. Now researchers suspect that dreams are part of the mind’s emotional thermostat, regulating moods while the brain is “off-line.” And one leading authority says that these intensely powerful mental events can be not only harnessed but actually brought under conscious control, to help us sleep and feel better, “It’s your dream,” says Rosalind Cartwright, chair of psychology at Chicago’s Medical Center. “If you don’t like it, change it.”
Evidence from brain imaging supports this view. The brain is as active during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep -- when most vivid dreams occur -- as it is when fully awake, says Dr, Eric Nofzinger at the University of Pittsburgh. But not all parts of the brain are equally involved; the limbic system (the “emotional brain”) is especially active, while the prefrontal cortex (the center of intellect and reasoning) is relatively quiet. “We wake up from dreams happy or depressed, and those feelings can stay with us all day.” says Stanford sleep researcher Dr. William Dement.
The link between dreams and emotions shows up among the patients in Cartwright’s clinic. Most people seem to have more bad dreams early in the night, progressing toward happier ones before awakening, suggesting that they are working through negative feelings generated during the day. Because our conscious mind is occupied with daily life we don’t always think about the emotional significance of the day’s events -- until, it appears, we begin to dream.
And this process need not be left to the unconscious. Cartwright believes one can exercise conscious control over recurring bad dreams. As soon as you awaken, identify what is upsetting about the dream. Visualize how you would like it to end instead; the next time it occurs, try to wake up just enough to control its course. With much practice people can learn to, literally, do it in their sleep.
At the end of the day, there’s probably little reason to pay attention to our dreams at all unless they keep us from sleeping or “we wake up in a panic,” Cartwright says. Terrorism, economic uncertainties and general feelings of insecurity have increased people’s anxiety. Those suffering from persistent nightmares should seek help from a therapist. For the rest of us, the brain has its ways of working through bad feelings. Sleep -- or rather dream -- on it and you’ll feel better in the morning.

33.	The negative feelings generated during the day tend to ________.
[A] aggravate in our unconscious mind
[B] develop into happy dreams
[C] persist till the time we fall asleep
[D] show up in dreams early at night

[A] waking up in time is essential to the ridding of bad dreams
[B] visualizing bad dreams helps bring them under control
[C] dreams should be left to their natural progression
[D] dreaming may not entirely belong to the unconscious

Text 4
Americans no longer expect public figures, whether in speech or in writing, to command the English language with skill and gift. Nor do they aspire to such command themselves. In his latest book, Doing Our Own Thing: The Degradation of Language and Music and Why We Should, Like, Care, John McWhorter, a linguist and controversialist of mixed liberal and conservative views, sees the triumph of 1960s counter-culture as responsible for the decline of formal English.
Blaming the permissive 1960s is nothing new, but this is not yet another criticism against the decline in education. Mr. McWhorter’s academic speciality is language history and change, and he sees the gradual disappearance of “whom,” for example, to be natural and no more regrettable than the loss of the case-endings of Old English.
But the cult of the authentic and the personal, “doing our own thing,” has spelt the death of formal speech, writing, poetry and music. While even the modestly educated sought an elevated tone when they put pen to paper before the 1960s, even the most well regarded writing since then has sought to capture spoken English on the page. Equally, in poetry, the highly personal, performative genre is the only form that could claim real liveliness. In both oral and written English, talking is triumphing over speaking, spontaneity over craft.
Illustrated with an entertaining array of examples from both high and low culture, the trend that Mr. McWhorter documents is unmistakable. But it is less clear, to take the question of his subtitle, why we should, like, care. As a linguist, he acknowledges that all varieties of human language, including non-standard ones like Black English, can be powerfully expressive -- there exists no language or dialect in the world that cannot convey complex ideas. He is not arguing, as many do, that we can no longer think straight because we do not talk proper.
Russians have a deep love for their own language and carry large chunks of memorized poetry in their heads, while Italian politicians tend to elaborate speech that would seem old-fashioned to most English-speakers. Mr. McWhorter acknowledges that formal language is not strictly necessary, and proposes no radical education reforms -- he is really grieving over the loss of something beautiful more than useful. We now take our English “on paper plates instead of china.” A shame, perhaps, but probably an inevitable one.
36.	According to McWhorter, the decline of formal English ________.
[A] is inevitable in radical education reforms
[B] is but all too natural in language development
[C] has caused the controversy over the counter-culture
[D] brought about changes in public attitudes in the 1960s
37.	The word “talking” (Line 6, Paragraph 3) denotes ________.
[A] modesty
[B] personality
[C] liveliness
[D] informality
38.	To which of the following statements would McWhorter most likely agree?
[A] Logical thinking is not necessarily related to the way we talk.
[B] Black English can be more expressive than standard English.
[C] Non-standard varieties of human language are just as entertaining.
[D] Of all the varieties, standard English can best convey complex ideas.
39.	The description of Russians’ love of memorizing poetry shows the author’s ________.
[A] interest in their language
[B] appreciation of their efforts
[C] admiration for their memory
[D] contempt for their old-fashionedness
40.	According to the last paragraph, “paper plates” is to “china” as ________.
[A] “temporary” is to “permanent”
[B] “radical” is to “conservative”
[C] “functional” is to “artistic”
[D] “humble” is to “noble”

Canada’s premiers (the leaders of provincial governments), if they have any breath left after complaining about Ottawa at their late July annual meeting, might spare a moment to do something, together, to reduce health-care costs.
They’re all groaning about soaring health budgets, the fastest-growing component of which are pharmaceutical costs.
41.	________
What to do? Both the Romanow commission and the Kirby committee on health care -- to say nothing of reports from other experts -- recommended the creation of a national drug agency. Instead of each province having its own list of approved drugs, bureaucracy, procedures and limited bargaining power, all would pool resources, work with Ottawa, and create a national institution.
42.	________
But “national” doesn’t have to mean that. “National” could mean interprovincial -- provinces combining efforts to create one body.
Either way, one benefit of a “national” organization would be to negotiate better prices, if possible, with drug manufacturers. Instead of having one province -- or a series of hospitals within a province -- negotiate a price for a given drug on the provincial list, the national agency would negotiate on behalf of all provinces.
Rather than, say, Quebec, negotiating on behalf of seven million people, the national agency would negotiate on behalf of 31 million people. Basic economics suggests the greater the potential consumers, the higher the likelihood of a better price.
43.	________
A small step has been taken in the direction of a national agency with the creation of the Canadian Co-ordinating Office for Health Technology Assessment, funded by Ottawa and the provinces. Under it, a Common Drug Review recommends to provincial lists which new drugs should be included. Predictably, and regrettably, Quebec refused to join.
A few premiers are suspicious of any federal-provincial deal-making. They (particularly Quebec and Alberta) just want Ottawa to fork over additional billions with few, if any, strings attached. That’s one reason why the idea of a national list hasn’t gone anywhere, while drug costs keep rising fast.
44.	________
Premiers love to quote Mr. Romanow’s report selectively, especially the parts about more federal money. Perhaps they should read what he had to say about drugs: “A national drug agency would provide governments more influence on pharmaceutical companies in order to constrain the ever-increasing cost of drugs.”
45.	________
So when the premiers gather in Niagara Falls to assemble their usual complaint list, they should also get cracking about something in their jurisdiction that would help their budgets and patients.
[A] Quebec’s resistance to a national agency is provincialist ideology. One of the first advocates for a national list was a researcher at Laval University. Quebec’s Drug Insurance Fund has seen its costs skyrocket with annual increases from 14.3 per cent to 26.8 per cent!
[B] Or they could read Mr. Kirby’s report: “the substantial buying power of such an agency would strengthen the public prescription-drug insurance plans to negotiate the lowest possible purchase prices from drug companies.”
[C] What does “national” mean? Roy Romanow and Senator Michael Kirby recommended a federal-provincial body much like the recently created National Health Council.
[D] The problem is simple and stark: health-care costs have been, are, and will continue to increase faster than government revenues.
[E] According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information, prescription drug costs have risen since 1997 at twice the rate of overall health-care spending. Part of the increase comes from drugs being used to replace other kinds of treatments. Part of it arises from new drugs costing more than older kinds. Part of it is higher prices.
[F] So, if the provinces want to run the health-care show, they should prove they can run it, starting with an interprovincial health list that would end duplication, save administrative costs, prevent one province from being played off against another, and bargain for better drug prices.
[G] Of course, the pharmaceutical companies will scream. They like divided buyers; they can lobby better that way. They can use the threat of removing jobs from one province to another. They can hope that, if one province includes a drug on its list, the pressure will cause others to include it on theirs. They wouldn’t like a national agency, but self-interest would lead them to deal with it.

It is not easy to talk about the role of the mass media in this overwhelmingly significant phase in European history. History and news become confused, and one’s impressions tend to be a mixture of skepticism and optimism. 46) Television is one of the means by which these feelings are created and conveyed -- and perhaps never before has it served so much to connect different peoples and nations as in the recent events in Europe. The Europe that is now forming cannot be anything other than its peoples, their cultures and national identities. With this in mind we can begin to analyze the European television scene. 47) In Europe, as elsewhere, multi-media groups have been increasingly successful: groups which bring together television, radio, newspapers, magazines and publishing houses that work in relation to one another. One Italian example would be the Berlusconi group, while abroad Maxwell and Murdoch come to mind.
Clearly, only the biggest and most flexible television companies are going to be able to compete in such a rich and hotly-contested market. 48) This alone demonstrates that the television business is not an easy world to survive in, a fact underlined by statistics that show that out of eighty European television networks, no less than 50% took a loss in 1989.
Moreover, the integration of the European community will oblige television companies to cooperate more closely in terms of both production and distribution.
49) Creating a “European identity” that respects the different cultures and traditions which go to make up the connecting fabric of the Old Continent is no easy task and demands a strategic choice -- that of producing programs in Europe for Europe. This entails reducing our dependence on the North American market, whose programs relate to experiences and cultural traditions which are different from our own.
In order to achieve these objectives, we must concentrate more on co-productions, the exchange of news, documentary services and training. This also involves the agreements between European countries for the creation of a European bank for Television Production which, on the model of the European Investments Bank, will handle the finances necessary for production costs. 50) In dealing with a challenge on such a scale, it is no exaggeration to say “United we stand, divided we fall” -- and if I had to choose a slogan it would be “Unity in our diversity.” A unity of objectives that nonetheless respect the varied peculiarities of each country.

2005年考研英语真题答案解析
Section I  Use of English  
1. 【答案】[C] 
【解析】空格前讲的是，和动物相比，人的嗅觉常被认为不灵敏，空格后讲的是，…这主要是因为，…动物，我们是直立的。由本段首句"人的鼻子是一个被低估的工具"可知，作者并不认同"人的嗅觉没有动物的灵敏"这一有关人类嗅觉的常规观点。由此可推知，空格前后部分存在隐形的转折关系，即作者并不认为人的鼻子不灵敏，只不过因为人是直立的，故正确答案为C项。   
2. 【答案】[B] 
【解析】空格所在部分讲的是，这主要是因为，…动物，我们是直立的。因人类是直立的，而动物不是直立的。由此可知，空格处所填单词应表示对比含义，unlike意为"与…不同"，符合文意，故选B。  
 3. 【答案】[A] 
【解析】空格所在部分讲这意味着我们的鼻子…感知在空气中飘过的气味。由上句可知，和动物不同，人类是直立的，由此可知，人的鼻子只能感知在空气中飘过的气味。因此空格处应填表示"局限"的词。limit和confine都表示"局限"，但confine意为"限制"，表示限制在一定活动、领域、地域内。limit意为"局限于"，表示时间、空间、程度、数量等方面所能或允许达到的最大程度，符合文意，故选A。
4. 【答案】[C] 
【解析】空格所在部分讲的是，…大多数紧贴地面的气味。由上文可知，和动物不同，人类是直立的，人的鼻子只限于感知在空气中飘过的气味。由此可知，人类"不能感知"大多数紧贴地面的气味。catch意为"捕捉"，track意为"追踪"，显然都不符合文意。ignore意为主观上"忽视"，文中并没有体现人们故意忽视地面上的气味，因此，不符合文意。miss意为"错过，未察觉"，符合文意，即人的鼻子只限于感知在空气中飘过的气味，"未能察觉到"大多数紧贴地面的气味。
5. 【答案】[B] 
【解析】空格所在部分讲的是，事实上,…，我们对气味非常敏感。由上文可知，人的鼻子只限于感知在空气中飘过的气味，而遗漏了大多数紧贴地面的气味。由此可知空格所在部分和上文间为转折关系。though作副词时，意为"可是"，符合文意，故选B项。
6. 【答案】[A] 
【解析】空格所在句讲的是，然而，实际上，我们对气味非常敏感，…我们通常意识不到这一点。显然，空格前后为让步关系，even if意为"即使"，符合文意，故选A。  
7. 【答案】[D] 
【解析】空格所在部分讲的是，我们的鼻子能够…人类的气味。由此可知，空格处需填入一个动词，和后面的"人类的气味"构成动宾搭配。distinguish意为"区分，辨别"，常表示"人通过看、听的感官来识别事物"，discover意为"（第一个）发现"，determine意为"查明，测定"，显然，这三项均不符合文意。detect意为"查明，察觉"，符合文意，即"我们的鼻子能够觉察人类的气味"，故选D。
8. 【答案】[A] 
【解析】空格所在句讲即使这些气味被…到百万分之一以下。dissolve意为"溶解"，disperse意为"分散"，diffuse意为"使分散"，这三项均不能修饰human smells。dilute意为"稀释"，合文意，即"我们的鼻子能够觉察人类的气味，即使这些气味被稀释到百万分之一以下"，故选A。
9. 【答案】[D] 
【解析】空格所在句的含义为"奇怪的是，一些人发现他们能闻到一种花的气味却闻不到另一种，…另一些人对这两种花的气味同样敏感"。显然，空格前后为对比关系，whereas意为"然而，但是"，用于比较或对比两个事实，符合文意，故正确答案为D项。
10. 【答案】[B] 
【解析】空格所在句的含义为"这可能是因为有些人不具备必要的基因在鼻子里产生…的气味接收器"。由文意可知，这句话是对上一句话的解释，即一些人闻不到另一种花的气味是因为他们不具备必要的基因在鼻子里产生…的气味接收器。由此可推知，这种气味接收器是"特定的"，故选B项。
11. 【答案】[C] 
【解析】空格所在句的含义为"这些气味接收器是一些细胞，它们感知到气味，并向大脑发送…。""向大脑发送信号"符合逻辑与文意，故正确答案为C项。
12. 【答案】[A] 
【解析】空格所在句讲的是，但是，研究发现，即使是对某种气味不敏感的人…，如果经常…这种气味，也会突然变得对它敏感起来。由此可知，本句是讲人对气味的敏感在某种条件下可以改变。因此可推知，"之前"，人对这种气味是不敏感的。at first意为"起初，起先"，符合逻辑与文意，故选A。  
13. 【答案】[D] 
【解析】空格所在部分省略了主语people和be动词，讲的是人对某种气味由"不敏感"变得"敏感"的条件。由此可推知，人只有经常"闻到"这种气味，才会对它变得敏感，be exposed to意为"暴露于"，符合文意，即"如果经常接触这种气味"，故正确答案为D项。
14. 【答案】[C] 
【解析】空格所在部分讲嗅觉不敏感的原因可能是因为大脑觉得，使所有气味接收器一直工作…，考生需判断"所有气味接收器一直工作"的后果。incompetent意为"无能力的，不胜任的"，主语一般是人，因此不合文意。另外，所有气味接收器一直工作也不会"没效果"或"不充分"，因此，A和D也不符合文意。inefficient意为"效率低的"，符合文意，即"所有气味接收器一直工作效率不高"，故选C。  
15. 【答案】[D] 
【解析】空格所在部分讲的是，但是在需要时，大脑可以…新的气味接收器。由上文可知，大脑不让所有的气味接收器一直工作，因为那样的效率很低。由but可知，空格所在部分和上文构成转折关系，因此，空格处所填单词应有"使气味接收器工作"的含义。summon意为"召唤"，主语一般是人，因此不符合文意。另外，大脑也不可能"推行"或是"引起"新的气味接收器，因此，选项A和C也不符合文意。create意为"创造；创作"，符合文意，即"但是在需要时，大脑可以创建新的气味接收器"，故选D。 
16. 【答案】[B] 
【解析】空格所在句讲这可以…解释为什么我们总是对自己的气味不敏感--只是不需要而已。由文意可知，其中"this"指代上一句提到的大脑工作的原理，即"大脑觉得，使所有气味接收器一直工作效率低下"。由此可知，和上一句提到的"嗅觉不敏感的原因"一样，"我们总是对自己的气味不敏感"的原因也能用大脑的这个工作原理来解释。因此，空格所在句和上句为并列关系，also意为"也"，符合文意。  
17. 【答案】[C] 
【解析】空格所在部分讲的是，我们不会…自己家里的气味。由上文可知，我们总是对自己的气味不敏感，由此可推知，我们对熟悉的气味不敏感，故我们对自己家里的气味也会"不敏感"。be aware of意为"察觉到，发觉"，符合文意，故正确答案为C项。
18. 【答案】[D] 
【解析】空格所在部分讲的是，我们察觉不到自己家里惯有的气味，但是当我们拜访其他人的家时，就会…新的气味。由"但是"可知，这两句之间为转折关系，因此，空格处所填单词的含义应与"察觉不到"相反。notice意为"意识到"，符合文意，故选D项。
19. 【答案】[A] 
【解析】空格所在部分讲的是，大脑发现最好让气味接收器…以便捕捉不熟悉和紧急的信号，此处for表示对象。由此可知，气味接收器只有是"可使用的"，而不是"可靠的"、"可辨认的"或是"合适的"，才能捕捉不熟悉和紧急的信号，故正确答案为A项。  
20. 【答案】[B] 
【解析】空格前讲"不熟悉和紧急的信号"，空格后讲"可能意味着有火险的烟味"。"可能意味着有火险的烟味"是"紧急的信号"的一种。由此可知空格前后为例证关系，故选B。

【解析】观点态度题。根据第五段的内容，作者首先描述了俄罗斯人爱好背诵诗歌以及意大利的政客们倾向于精心准备演讲。作者举例的目的就是为了说明下文的观点，即"麦克沃特为那些虽不实用却很美好的事物的消逝而哀叹"。由此可知，在作者的眼里，"俄罗斯人爱好背诵诗歌"和"意大利的政客精心准备演讲"都属于"虽不实用却很美好的事物"。由此可以推知，作者对俄罗斯人的做法持欣赏态度，所以才表达出对美好事物正在消逝的哀叹，故选B项。
40. 【答案】[C] 
【解析】推理判断题。根据第五段第②③句可知，麦克沃特先生认为"正式英语"并非不可或缺，他也未提出要对教育进行彻底改革--其实他只是为那些"虽不实用却很美好的事物"的消逝而哀叹，如今我们用"纸盘子"而非"瓷盘子"来装我们的英语大餐。这可能是件惭愧的事情，但已经无法避免。由此可知，作者用"纸盘子"和"瓷盘子"来比喻正式英语的退化，联系上文可以推知，"纸盘子"指的是那些"实用却不美好"的事物，即非正式英语，"瓷盘子"则是指那些"不实用却美好"的事物，即正式英语，故选C。

Part B 
41．【答案】[E] 
【解析】因果关系。空格前面提到加拿大各省官员都在抱怨医疗预算的飞涨，尤其是药品费用的不断增长。空格后面的内容则由"what to do"引出下文对此问题的解决办法。可以看出两段内容衔接紧密，因此空白处的内容也须和"药品费用"有关。浏览各选项，只有E选项提到了"药品费用"，包括药品价格上涨的幅度和具体表现，恰好为上一段提到的"药费"上涨提供了依据，构成因果逻辑关系。
42．【答案】[C] 
【解析】转折关系。空格前面提到建立国家药物管理机构，空格后面则以"but"引出了转折，说"国家"不一定指那个意思，接下来就表述了它的一个概念，即各省联合起来成立的一个机构。可知，空白处的内容应是对"国家"的一个解释，而代词"that"即指代这一概念。
43．【答案】[G] 
【解析】顺接关系。空格前面谈到成立国家机构来争取降低药品的价格，如从经济学角度讲，潜在客户群越大，获得优惠价格的可能性就越大。空后讲到成立国家代理机构后取得的一项小突破。据上下文逻辑关系推断，空白处内容也应围绕成立国家代理机构而展开。浏览各选项，提到"national agency" 或同义词的有A, B, G，而对于B项中出现的指代词"they", 无法从上文中找到所指代的相应名词，所以排除。A项最易误选，因为它和上文都提到了专有名词Quebec, 但其内容主要是魁北克地方保护主义的表现和药品上涨的情况，与前后内容不衔接，因此不对。G选项涉及医药公司对设立国家药物机构的反应，表明其成立具有现实可能性，与下文所取得的进展存在着内容与逻辑上的一致性。
44．【答案】[F] 
【解析】顺接关系。空格前面讲到某些省对联邦政府和省政府之间的交易持怀疑态度，空格后则指出这些省长们应该读读报告中有关药品的论述，了解成立国家药物机构的好处。可以推断，空白处内容要么是继续讨论来自这些省份的阻力，即承上；要么是建议他们更多了解成立国家机构的意义，即启下。符合条件的有B和F两项，但由于B项开头的并列连词 "or" 使其无法与上文衔接，因此不对。F项虽然把上文的关键词"premiers"换成了"provinces", 但其内容还是建议各省实现全国药物代理机构的功能，与上下文内容逻辑关系紧密。
45．【答案】[B] 
【解析】对照关系。空前指出省长们应该读读Romanow的报告，B项则提到读一读Kirby的报告，结构与上文类似，且还重复运用了关键词 "report", 即暗含两份报告存在意义上的相似或相反特征。另外，两个专有名词Mr. Romanow和Mr. Kirby都已在第四段中被提到，他们都提倡建立国家药物代理机构。

46. 【考点】被动语态的翻译，技巧就是通常把英文的被动语态翻译成中文的主动语态，即翻译技巧中的语态转换翻译。这样可翻成这样“电视是制造和传播这种情绪的媒介（手段、方式）之一”。 下面的采分点是倒装句，把否定词放在句前，形成一个倒装。这句翻译要注意，要把整个的句子看懂，进行词性、语序的转换。把“从来也没有如此大的作用”放在句末。这也是翻译的一个转换技巧。  
【译文】电视是创造和传递感情的手段之一。也许在此之前，就加强不同的民族和国家之间的联系而言，电视还从来没有像在最近的欧洲事件中起过如此大的作用。 
47. 【考点】前面几乎可以直译，“在欧洲就像在其他地方一样多媒体集团越来越成功了”。当然根据中文表达可把句子加以转换，译成“和其他地方一样，欧洲的多媒体集团越来越成熟”。下半句有个定语从句离主干的句子较远，在句末，但翻译时须提前。  
【译文】多媒体集团在欧洲就像在其他地方一样越来越成功了。这些集团把相互关系密切的电视台、电台、报纸、杂志、出版社整合到了一起。 
48.【考点】代词要依赖上下文内容，代词后有副词“alone”，“alone”译成“仅此一点”，“仅这一点就表明在电视行业里生存不那么容易”。此外“underlined”，考了它一个特殊意义 “强调；凸显” 。 
【译文】仅这一点就表明在电视行业不是一个容易生存的领域。这个事实通过统计数字一目了然，统计表明在80家欧洲电视网中1989年出现亏损的不少于50%。
49.【考点】嵌套式定语从句使主语的后置定语很长，翻译时需要先根据原句的次序梳理思路，再按照汉语的行文习惯，将后置的定语从句提前，放于被限定的名词之前翻译。
【译文】创造一个尊重不同文化和传统的“欧洲统一体”绝非易事，需要战略性选择。正是这些文化和传统组成了连接欧洲大陆的纽带。 
50.【考点】宾语从句为含有对称结构的两个并列分句，过去分词united和divided分别在两个分句中作条件状语。
【译文】在应付一个如此规模的挑战过程中，我们可以毫不夸张地说，“团结，我们就会站起来；分裂，我们就会倒下去。”

A Helpless Father
The picture ironically shows that a pitiable old man in rags is being helplessly kicked off by his three sons and a daughter, who all wear decent clothes. The father’s negligent children are all guarding their home gates lest their old father “roll into” their households. In other words, they four ignore their moral sense of assuming the responsibility for their old father even though they may be all living a satisfying life. That is a painful scene we often encounter in our daily life.
Sad to say, the moral decline of the younger generations may be a rather explosive situation in our modern society. People definitely have their living conditions improved by wider and wider margins, as evidenced by the four children’s decent dressing, but their moral sense still remains sadly unchanged or in some cases becomes dramatically downgrading. Most people might have become too much self-centered, and even worse, they discard the tradition of giving respect to the elderly. They no longer care for their elders, let alone their neighbors or the disadvantaged; instead they try every means to avoid responsibility for other citizens. When one cares for others, one might even appear stupid or may even be distrusted.
Therefore, we have to take some useful measures to avoid the scene that is mentioned above. We must launch a variety of campaigns about the return to the good tradition of giving help and love to the elderly. Moreover, we must appeal to our government to establish some relevant laws to punish those who avoid their duties. The last but not the least, our respect for age is an indication of the progress of human society, as imperatives of traditions require. We sincerely wish that the old man could be welcome to any of the four households, elegantly dressed, and a smile on the face.

Text 1
Every Saturday morning, at 9 am, more than 50,000 runners set off to run 5km around their local park. The Parkrun phenomenon began with a dozen friends and has inspired 400 events in the UK and more abroad. Events are free, staffed by thousands of volunteers. Runners range from four years old to grandparents; their times range from Andrew Baddeley's world record 13 minutes 48 seconds up to an hour.
Parkrun is succeeding where London's Olympic "legacy" is failing. Ten years ago on Monday, it was announced that the Games of the 30th Olympiad would be in London. Planning documents pledged that the great legacy of the Games would be to level a nation of sport lovers away from their couches. The population would be fitter, healthier and produce more winners. It has not happened. The number of adults doing weekly sport did rise, by nearly 2 million in the run－up to 2012－but the general population was growing faster. Worse, the numbers are now falling at an accelerating rate. The opposition claims primary school pupils doing at least two hours of sport a week have nearly halved. Obesity has risen among adults and children. Official retrospections continue as to why London 2012 failed to "inspire a generation." The success of Parkrun offers answers.
Parkun is not a race but a time trial: Your only competitor is the clock. The ethos welcomes anybody. There is as much joy over a puffed-out first-timer being clapped over the line as there is about top talent shining. The Olympic bidders, by contrast, wanted to get more people doing sports and to produce more elite athletes. The dual aim was mixed up: The stress on success over taking part was intimidating for newcomers.
Indeed, there is something a little absurd in the state getting involved in the planning of such a fundamentally "grassroots", concept as community sports associations. If there is a role for government, it should really be getting involved in providing common goods－making sure there is space for playing fields and the money to pave tennis and netball courts, and encouraging the provision of all these activities in schools. But successive governments have presided over selling green spaces, squeezing money from local authorities and declining attention on sport in education. Instead of wordy, worthy strategies, future governments need to do more to provide the conditions for sport to thrive. Or at least not make them worse.

21. According to Paragraph1, Parkrun has_____.
A．gained great popularity
B．created many jobs
C．strengthened community ties
D．become an official festival
 22. The author believes that London's Olympic "legacy" has failed to_____.

A．aims at discovering talents
B．focuses on mass competition
C．does not emphasize elitism
D．does not attract first-timers
 24. With regard to mass sport, the author holds that governments should_____.
A．organize "grassroots" sports events
B．supervise local sports associations
C．increase funds for sports clubs
D．invest in public sports facilities
  25. The author's attitude to what UK governments have done for sports is_____.
A．tolerant

With so much focus on children’s use of screens, it's easy for parents to forget about their own screen use. “Tech is designed to really suck on you in,” says Jenny Radesky in her study of digital play, "and digital products are there to promote maximal engagement. It makes it hard to disengage, and leads to a lot of bleed-over into the family routine.”
Radesky has studied the use of mobile phones and tablets at mealtimes by giving mother-child pairs a food-testing exercise. She found that mothers who sued devices during the exercise started 20 percent fewer verbal and 39 percent fewer nonverbal interactions with their children. During a separate observation, she saw that phones became a source of tension in the family. Parents would be looking at their emails while the children would be making excited bids for their attention.
Infants are wired to look at parents’ faces to try to understand their world, and if those faces are blank and unresponsive―as they often are when absorbed in a device－it can be extremely disconcerting foe the children. Radesky cites the “still face experiment” devised by developmental psychologist Ed Tronick in the 1970s. In it, a mother is asked to interact with her child in a normal way before putting on a blank expression and not giving them any visual social feedback; The child becomes increasingly distressed as she tries to capture her mother’s attention. "Parents don't have to be exquisitely parents at all times, but there needs to be a balance and parents need to be responsive and sensitive to a child’s verbal or nonverbal expressions of an emotional need," says Radesky.
On the other hand, Tronick himself is concerned that the worries about kids' use of screens are born out of an “oppressive ideology that demands that parents should always be interacting” with their children: “It’s based on a somewhat fantasized, very white, very upper-middle-class ideology that says if you’re failing to expose your child to 30,000 words you are neglecting them.” Tronick believes that just because a child isn’t learning from the screen doesn’t mean there’s no value to it－particularly if it gives parents time to have a shower, do housework or simply have a break from their child. Parents, he says, can get a lot out of using their devices to speak to a friend or get some work out of the way. This can make them feel happier, which lets then be more available to their child the rest of the time.
26. According to Jenny Radesky, digital products are designed to ______.
A．simplify routine matters
B．absorb user attention
C．better interpersonal relations
D．increase work efficiency  27. Radesky’s food-testing exercise shows that mothers’ use of devices ______.

A．takes away babies’ appetite
B．distracts children’s attention
C．slows down babies’ verbal development
D．reduces mother-child communication  28. Radesky’s cites the “still face experiment” to show that _______.
A．it is easy for children to get used to blank expressions
B．verbal expressions are unnecessary for emotional exchange
C．children are insensitive to changes in their parents’ mood
D．parents need to respond to children's emotional needs
 29. The oppressive ideology mentioned by Tronick requires parents to_______.
A．protect kids from exposure to wild fantasies
B．teach their kids at least 30,000 words a year
C．ensure constant interaction with their children
D．remain concerned about kid's use of screens
 30. According to Tronick, kid’s use of screens may_______.

A．give their parents some free time
B．make their parents more creative
C．help them with their homework
D．help them become more attentive

Text 3
Today, widespread social pressure to immediately go to college in conjunction with increasingly high expectations in a fast-moving world often causes students to completely overlook the possibility of taking a gap year. After all, if everyone you know is going to college in the fall, it seems silly to stay back a year, doesn't it? And after going to school for 12 years, it doesn't feel natural to spend a year doing something that isn’t academic.
But while this may be true, it’s not a good enough reason to condemn gap years. There's always a constant fear of falling behind everyone else on the socially perpetuated “race to the finish line,” whether that be toward graduate school, medical school or lucrative career. But despite common misconceptions, a gap year does not hinder the success of academic pursuits－in fact, it probably enhances it.
Studies from the United States and Australia show that students who take a gap year are generally better prepared for and perform better in college than those who do not. Rather than pulling students back, a gap year pushes them ahead by preparing them for independence, new responsibilities and environmental changes－all things that first-year students often struggle with the most. Gap year experiences can lessen the blow when it comes to adjusting to college and being thrown into a brand new environment, making it easier to focus on academics and activities rather than acclimation blunders.
If you're not convinced of the inherent value in taking a year off to explore interests, then consider its financial impact on future academic choices. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, nearly 80 percent of college students end up changing their majors at least once. This isn’t surprising, considering the basic mandatory high school curriculum leaves students with a poor understanding of themselves listing one major on their college applications, but switching to another after taking college classes. It’s not necessarily a bad thing, but depending on the school, it can be costly to make up credits after switching too late in the game. At Boston College, for example, you would have to complete an extra year were you to switch to the nursing school from another department. Taking a gap year to figure things out initially can help prevent stress and save money later on.
31. One of the reasons for high-school graduates not taking a gap year is that_____.

A．they think it academically misleading
B．they have a lot of fun to expect in college
C．it feels strange to do differently from others
D．it seems worthless to take off-campus courses
 32. Studies from the US and Australia imply that taking a gap year helps_____.

A．keep students from being unrealistic
B．lower risks in choosing careers
C．ease freshmen’s financial burdens
D．relieve freshmen of pressures

33. The word “acclimation”（Line 8, Para. 3） is closest in meaning to_____.

A．adaptation
B．application
C．motivation
D．competition 34. A gap year may save money for students by helping them_____.

A．avoid academic failures
B．establish long-term goals
C．switch to another college
D．decide on the right major

35. The most suitable title for this text would be_____.

A．In Favor of the Gap Year
B．The ABCs of the Gap Year
C．The Gap Year Comes Back
D．The Gap Year: A Dilemma  Text 4
Though often viewed as a problem for western states, the growing frequency of wildfires is a national concern because of its impact on federal tax dollars, says Professor Max Moritz, a specialist in fire ecology and management.
In 2015, the US Forest Service for the first time spent more than half of its $5.5 billion annual budget fighting fires－nearly double the percentage it spent on such efforts 20 years ago. In effect, fewer federal funds today are going towards the agency's other work－such as forest conservation, watershed and cultural resources management, and infrastructure upkeep－that affect the lives of all Americans.
Another nationwide concern is whether public funds from other agencies are going into construction in fire-prone districts. As Moritz puts it, how often are federal dollars building homes that are likely to be lost to a wildfire?
“It’s already a huge problem from a public expenditure perspective for the whole country,” he says. We need to take a magnifying glass to that. Like, “Wait a minute, is this OK?”“Do we want instead to redirect those funds to concentrate on lower-hazard parts of the landscape?”
Such a view would require a corresponding shift in the way US society today views fire, researchers say.
For one thing, conversations about wildfires need to be more inclusive. Over the past decade, the focus has been on climate change－how the warming of the Earth from greenhouse gases is leading to conditions that worsen fires.
While climate is a key element, Moritz says, it shouldn’t come at the expense of the rest of the equation.
“The human systems and the landscapes we live on are linked, and the interactions go both ways," he says. Failing to recognize that, he notes, leads to "an overly simplified view of what the solutions might be. Our perception of the problem and of what the solution is becomes very limited.”
At the same time, people continue to treat fire as an event that needs to be wholly controlled and unleashed only out of necessity, says Professor Balch at the University of Colorado. But acknowledging fire's inevitable presence in human life is an attitude crucial to developing the laws, policies, and practices that make it as safe as possible, she says.
“We’ve disconnected ourselves from living with fire,” Balch says. “It is really important to understand and try and tease out what is the human connection with fire today.”
36. More frequent wildfires have become a national concern because in 2015 they_____.

A．exhausted unprecedented management efforts
B．consumed a record-high percentage of budget
C．severely damaged the ecology of western states
D．caused a huge rise of infrastructure expenditure
 37. Moritz calls for the use of "a magnifying glass" to _____.

A．raise more funds for fire-prone areas
B．avoid the redirection of federal money
C．find wildfire-free parts of the landscape
D．guarantee safer spending of public funds

38. While admitting that climate is a key element, Moritz notes that _____.

A．public debates have not settled yet
B．fire-fighting conditions are improving
C．other factors should not be overlooked
D．a shift in the view of fire has taken place
 39. The overly simplified view Moritz mentions is a result of failing to _____.

A．discover the fundamental makeup of nature
B．explore the mechanism of the human systems
C．maximize the role of landscape in human life
D．understand the interrelations of man and nature  40. Professor Balch points out that fire is something man should _____.

A．do away with
B．come to terms with
C．pay a price for
D．keep away from

The decline in American manufacturing is a common refrain, particularly from Donald Trump. "We don't make anything anymore," he told Fox News, while defending his own made-in-Mexico clothing line.
Without question, manufacturing has taken a significant hit during recent decades, and further trade deals raise questions about whether new shocks could hit manufacturing.
But there is also a different way to look at the data.
Across the country, factory owners are now grappling with a new challenge: instead of having too many workers, they may end up with too few. Despite trade competition and outsourcing, American manufacturing still needs to replace tens of thousands of retiring boomers every years. Millennials may not be that interested in taking their place, other industries are recruiting them with similar or better pay.
For factory owners, it all adds up to stiff competition for workers－and upward pressure on wages. "They're harder to find and they have job offers," says Jay Dunwell, president of Wolverine Coil Spring, a family-owned firm, "They may be coming [into the workforce], but they've been plucked by other industries that are also doing an well as manufacturing," Mr. Dunwell has begun bringing high school juniors to the factory so they can get exposed to its culture.
At RoMan Manufacturing, a maker of electrical transformers and welding equipment that his father cofounded in 1980, Robert Roth keep a close eye on the age of his nearly 200 workers, five are retiring this year. Mr. Roth has three community-college students enrolled in a work-placement program, with a starting wage of $13 an hour that rises to $17 after two years.
At a worktable inside the transformer plant, young Jason Stenquist looks flustered by the copper coils he's trying to assemble and the arrival of two visitors. It's his first week on the job. Asked about his choice of career, he says at high school he considered medical school before switching to electrical engineering. "I love working with tools. I love creating." he says.
But to win over these young workers, manufacturers have to clear another major hurdle: parents, who lived through the worst US economic downturn since the Great Depression, telling them to avoid the factory. Millennials "remember their father and mother both were laid off. They blame it on the manufacturing recession," says Birgit Klohs, chief executive of The Right Place, a business development agency for western Michigan.
These concerns aren't misplaced: Employment in manufacturing has fallen from 17 million in 1970 to 12 million in 2013. When the recovery began, worker shortages first appeared in the high-skilled trades. Now shortages are appearing at the mid-skill levels.
"The gap is between the jobs that take to skills and those that require a lot of skill," says Rob Spohr, a business professor at Montcalm Community College. "There're enough people to fill the jobs at McDonalds and other places where you don't need to have much skill. It's that gap in between, and that's where the problem is."
Julie Parks of Grand Rapids Community points to another key to luring Millennials into manufacturing: a work/life balance. While their parents were content to work long hours, young people value flexibility. "Overtime is not attractive to this generation. They really want to live their lives," she says.

　　My dream has always been to work somewhere in an area between fashion and publishing. Two years before graduating from secondary school, I took a sewing and design course thinking that I would move on to a fashion design course. However, during that course I realised that I was not good enough in this area to compete with other creative personalities in the future, so I decided that it was not the right path for me. Before applying for university I told everyone that I would study journalism, because writing was, and still is, one of my favourite activities. But, to be absolutely honest, I said it, because I thought that fashion and me together was just a dream - I knew that no one, apart from myself, could imagine me in the fashion industry at all!

Happy people work differently. They’re more productive, more creative, and willing to take greater risks. And new research suggests that happiness might influence 1 firms work, too.Companies located in place with happier people invest more, according to a recent research paper. 2 , firms in happy places spend more on R&D(research and development).That’s because happiness is linked to the kind of longer-term thinking 3 for making investment for the future.
The researchers wanted to know if the 4 and inclination for risk-taking that come with happiness would 5 the way companies invested. So they compared U.S. cities’ average happiness 6 by Gallup polling with the investment activity of publicly traded firms in those areas.7 enough, firms’ investment and R&D intensity were correlated with the happiness of the area in which they were 8. But it is really happiness that’s linked to investment, or could something else about happier cities 9 why firms there spend more on R&D? To find out, the researches controlled for various 10 that might make firms more likely to invest like size, industry , and sales-and-and for indicators that a place was 11 to live in, like growth in wages or population. They link between happiness and investment generally 12 even after accounting for these things.The correlation between happiness and investment was particularly strong for younger firms, which the authors 13 to “less confined decision making process” and the possible presence of younger and less 14 managers who are more likely to be influenced by sentiment.’’ The relationship was 15 stronger in places where happiness was spread more 16. Firms seem to invest more in places.17 this doesn’t prove that happiness causes firms to invest more or to take a longer-term view, the authors believe it at least 18 at that possibility. It’s not hard to imagine that local culture and sentiment would help 19 how executives think about the future. It surely seems plausible that happy people would be more forward Cthinking and creative and 20 R&D more than the average,” said one researcher.

It’s true that high-school coding classes aren’t essential for learning computer science in college. Students without experience can catch up after a few introductory courses, said Tom Cortina, the assistant dean at Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science.
However, Cortina said, early exposure is beneficial. When younger kids learn computer science, they learn that it’s not just a confusing, endless string of letters and numbers C but a tool to build apps, or create artwork, or test hypotheses. It’s not as hard for them to transform their thought processes as it is for older students. Breaking down problems into bite-sized chunks and using code to solve them becomes normal. Giving more children this training could increase the number of people interested in the field and help fill the jobs gap, Cortina said.
Students also benefit from learning something about coding before they get to college, where introductory computer-science classes are packed to the brim, which can drive the less-experienced or-determined students away.
The Flatiron School, where people pay to learn programming, started as one of the many coding bootcamps that’s become popular for adults looking for a career change. The high-schoolers get the same curriculum, but “we try to gear lessons toward things they’re interested in,” said Victoria Friedman, an instructor. For instance, one of the apps the students are developing suggests movies based on your mood.
The students in the Flatiron class probably won’t drop out of high school and build the next Facebook. Programming languages have a quick turnover, so the “Ruby on Rails” language they learned may not even be relevant by the time they enter the job market. But the skills they learn C how to think logically through a problem and organize the results C apply to any coding language, said Deborah Seehorn, an education consultant for the state of North Carolina.
Indeed, the Flatiron students might not go into IT at all. But creating a future army of coders is not the sole purpose of the classes. These kids are going to be surrounded by computers-in their pockets ,in their offices, in their homes Cfor the rest of their lives, The younger they learn how computers think, how to coax the machine into producing what they want Cthe earlier they learn that they have the power to do that Cthe better.
21.Cortina holds that early exposure to computer science makes it easier to _______
A. complete future job training
B. remodel the way of thinking
C. formulate logical hypotheses
D. perfect artwork production
22.In delivering lessons for high - schoolers , Flatiron has considered their________
A. experience
B. interest
C. career prospects
D. academic backgrounds
23.Deborah Seehorn believes that the skills learned at Flatiron will ________
A . help students learn other computer languages
B .have to be upgraded when new technologies come
C .need improving when students look for jobs
D. enable students to make big quick money
24.According to the last paragraph, Flatiron students are expected to ______
A. bring forth innovative computer technologies
B. stay longer in the information technology industry
C. become better prepared for the digitalized world
D. compete with a future army of programmers
25.The word “coax”(Line4,Para.6) is closest in meaning to ________
A. persuade
B. frighten
C. misguide
D. challenge

Biologists estimate that as many as 2 million lesser prairie chickens---a kind of bird living on stretching grasslands―once lent red to the often grey landscape of the midwestern and southwestern United States. But just some 22,000 birds remain today, occupying about 16% of the species 'historic range.
The crash was a major reason the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)decided to formally list the bird as threatened .“The lesser prairie chicken is in a desperate situation ,”said USFWS Director Daniel Ashe. Some environmentalists, however, were disappointed. They had pushed the agency to designate the bird as “endangered,” a status that gives federal officials greater regulatory power to crack down on threats .But Ashe and others argued that the” threatened” tag gave the federal government flexibility to try out new, potentially less confrontational conservations approaches. In particular, they called for forging closer collaborations with western state governments, which are often uneasy with federal action. and with the private landowners who control an estimated 95% of the prairie chicken's habitat.
Under the plan, for example, the agency said it would not prosecute landowner or businesses that unintentionally kill, harm, or disturb the bird, as long as they had signed a range―wide management plan to restore prairie chicken habitat. Negotiated by USFWS and the states, the plan requires individuals and businesses that damage habitat as part of their operations to pay into a fund to replace every acre destroyed with 2 new acres of suitable habitat .The fund will also be used to compensate landowners who set aside habitat , USFWS also set an interim goal of restoring prairie chicken populations to an annual average of 67,000 birds over the next 10 years .And it gives the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (WAFWA), a coalition of state agencies, the job of monitoring progress. Overall, the idea is to let “states” remain in the driver 's seat for managing the species,” Ashe said.
Not everyone buys the win-win rhetoric. Some Congress members are trying to block the plan, and at least a dozen industry groups, four states, and three environmental groups are challenging it in federal court. Not surprisingly, doesn’t go far enough. “The federal government is giving responsibility for managing the bird to the same industries that are pushing it to extinction, ” says biologist Jay Lininger.
26.The major reason for listing the lesser prairie as threatened is____.
[A]its drastically decreased population
[B]the underestimate of the grassland acreage
[C]a desperate appeal from some biologists
[D]the insistence of private landowners
27.The “threatened” tag disappointed some environmentalists in that it_____.

[D]went against conservation policies

[A]agree to pay a sum for compensation
[B]volunteer to set up an equally big habitat
[C]offer to support the WAFWA monitoring job
[D]promise to raise funds for USFWS operations
29.According to Ashe, the leading role in managing the species in______.
[A]the federal government
[B]the wildlife agencies
[C]the landowners
[D]the states
30.Jay Lininger would most likely support_______.

That everyone's too busy these days is a cliché. But one specific complaint is made especially mournfully: There's never any time to read.
What makes the problem thornier is that the usual time-management techniques don't seem sufficient. The web's full of articles offering tips on making time to read: “Give up TV” or “Carry a book with you at all times.” But in my experience, using such methods to free up the odd 30 minutes doesn't work. Sit down to read and the flywheel of work-related thoughts keeps spinning-or else you're so exhausted that a challenging book's the last thing you need. The modern mind, Tim Parks, a novelist and critic, writes, “is overwhelmingly inclined toward communication…It is not simply that one is interrupted; it is that one is actually inclined to interruption.” Deep reading requires not just time, but a special kind of time which can't be obtained merely by becoming more efficient.
In fact, “becoming more efficient” is part of the problem. Thinking of time as a resource to be maximised means you approach it instrumentally, judging any given moment as well spent only in so far as it advances progress toward some goal. Immersive reading, by contrast, depends on being willing to risk inefficiency, goallessness, even time-wasting. Try to slot it as a to-do list item and you'll manage only goal-focused reading-useful, sometimes, but not the most fulfilling kind. “The future comes at us like empty bottles along an unstoppable and nearly infinite conveyor belt,” writes Gary Eberle in his book Sacred Time, and “we feel a pressure to fill these different-sized bottles (days, hours, minutes) as they pass, for if they get by without being filled, we will have wasted them.” No mind-set could be worse for losing yourself in a book.
So what does work? Perhaps surprisingly, scheduling regular times for reading. You'd think this might fuel the efficiency mind-set, but in fact, Eberle notes, such ritualistic behaviour helps us “step outside time's flow” into “soul time.” You could limit distractions by reading only physical books, or on single-purpose e-readers. “Carry a book with you at all times” can actually work, too-providing you dip in often enough, so that reading becomes the default state from which you temporarily surface to take care of business, before dropping back down. On a really good day, it no longer feels as if you're “making time to read,” but just reading, and making time for everything else.
31. The usual time-management techniques don’t work because .
[A] what they can offer does not ease the modern mind
[B] what challenging books demand is repetitive reading
[C] what people often forget is carrying a book with them
[D] what deep reading requires cannot be guaranteed
32. The “empty bottles” metaphor illustrates that people feel a pressure to .
[A] update their to-do lists
[B] make passing time fulfilling
[C] carry their plans through
[D] pursue carefree reading
33. Eberle would agree that scheduling regular times for reading helps .
[A] encourage the efficiency mind-set
[B] develop online reading habits
[C] promote ritualistic reading
[D] achieve immersive reading
34. “Carry a book with you at all times”can work if .
[A] reading becomes your primary business of the day
[B] all the daily business has been promptly dealt with
[C] you are able to drop back to business after reading
[D] time can be evenly split for reading and business
35. The best title for this text could be .
[A] How to Enjoy Easy Reading
[B] How to Find Time to Read
[C] How to Set Reading Goals
[D] How to Read Extensively

Against a backdrop of drastic changes in economy and population structure, younger Americans are drawing a new 21st-century road map to success, a latest poll has found.
Across generational lines, Americans continue to prize many of the same traditional milestones of a successful life, including getting married, having children, owning a home, and retiring in their sixties. But while young and old mostly agree on what constitutes the finish line of a fulfilling life, they offer strikingly different paths for reaching it.
Young people who are still getting started in life were more likely than older adults to prioritize personal fulfillment in their work, to believe they will advance their careers most by regularly changing jobs, to favor communities with more public services and a faster pace of life, to agree that couples should be financially secure before getting married or having children, and to maintain that children are best served by two parents working outside the home, the survey found.
From career to community and family, these contrasts suggest that in the aftermath of the searing Great Recession, those just starting out in life are defining priorities and expectations that will increasingly spread through virtually all aspects of American life, from consumer preferences to housing patterns to politics.
Young and old converge on one key point: Overwhelming majorities of both groups said they believe it is harder for young people today to get started in life than it was for earlier generations. Whlie younger people are somewhat more optimistic than their elders about the prospects for those starting out today, big majorities in both groups believe those “just getting started in life” face a tougher a good-paying job, starting a family, managing debt, and finding affordable housing.
Pete Schneider considers the climb tougher today. Schneider, a 27-yaear-old auto technician from the Chicago suburbs says he struggled to find a job after graduating from college. Even now that he is working steadily, he said.” I can’t afford to pay ma monthly mortgage payments on my own, so I have to rent rooms out to people to mark that happen.” Looking back, he is struck that his parents could provide a comfortable life for their children even though neither had completed college when he was young.“I still grew up in an upper middle-class home with parents who didn’t have college degrees,”Schneider said.“I don’t think people are capable of that anymore. ”
36. One cross-generation mark of a successful life is .
[A] trying out different lifestyles
[B] having a family with children
[C] working beyond retirement age
[D] setting up a profitable business
37. It can be learned from Paragraph 3 that young people tend to .
[A] favor a slower life pace
[B] hold an occupation longer
[C] attach importance to pre-marital finance
[D] give priority to childcare outside the home
38. The priorities and expectations defined by the young will .
[A] become increasingly clear
[B] focus on materialistic issues
[C] depend largely on political preferences
[D] reach almost all aspects of American life
39. Both young and old agree that .
[A] good-paying jobs are less available
[B] the old made more life achievements
[C] housing loans today are easy to obtain
[D] getting established is harder for the young
40. Which of the following is true about Schneider?
[A] He found a dream job after graduating from college
[B] His parents believe working steadily is a must for success
[C] His parents’ good life has little to do with a college degree
[D] He thinks his job as a technician quite challenging

(1) As adults, it seems that we’re constantly pursuing happiness, often with mixed results. Yet children appear to have it down to an art-and for the most part they don’t need self-help books or therapy. Instead, they look after their wellbeing instinctively and usually more effectively than we do as grownups. Perhaps it’s time to learn a few lessons from them.
41___________.
(2) What does a child do when he’s sad? He cries. When he’s angry? He shouts. Scared? Probably a bit of both. As we grow up, we learn to control our emotions so they are manageable and don’t dictate our behaviours, which is in many ways a good thing. But too often we take this process too far and end up suppressing emotions, especially negative ones. That’s about as effective as brushing dirt under a carpet and can even make us ill. What we feel appropriately and then-again, like children-move on.
42__________.
A couple of Christmases ago, my youngest stepdaughter, who was 9 years old at the time, got a Superman T-shirt for Christmas. It cost less than a fiver but she was overjoyed, and couldn’t bigger house or better car will be the magic silver bullet that will allow us to finally be content, but the reality is these things have little lasting impact on our happiness levels. Instead, being grateful for small things every day is a much better way to improve wellbeing.
43__________.
Have you ever noticed how much children laugh? If we adults could indulge in a bit of silliness and giggling, we would reduce the stress hormones in our bodies, increase good hormones like endorphins, improve blood flow to our hearts and ever have a greater chance of fighting off infection. All of which would, of course, have a positive effect on our happiness levels.
44__________.
The problem with being a grownup is that there’s an awful lot of serious stuff to deal with-work, mortgage payments, figuring out what to cook for dinner. But as adults we also have the luxury of being able to control our own diaries and it’s important that we schedule in time to enjoy the thing we love. Those things might be social, sporting, creative or completely random (dancing around the living room, anyone?)-it doesn’t matter, so long as they’re enjoyable, and not likely to have negative side effects, such as drinking too much alcohol or going on a wild spending spree if you’re on a tight budget.
45__________.
Having said all of the above, it’s important to add that we shouldn’t try too hard to be happy. Scientists tell us this can back fire and actually have a negative impact on our wellbeing. As the Chinese philosopher Chuang Tzu is reported to have said: “Happiness is the absence of striving for happiness.” And in that, once more, we need to look to the example of our children, to whom happiness is not a goal but a natural byproduct of the way they live.

The supermarket is designed to lure customers into spending as much time as possible within its doors. The reason for this is simple: The longer you stay in the store, the more stuff you’ll see, and the more stuff you see, the more you’ll buy. And supermarkets contain a lot of stuff. The average supermarket, according to the Food Marketing Institute, carries some 44,000 different items, and many carry tens of thousands more. The sheer volume of available choice is enough to send shoppers into a state of information overload. According to brain-scan experiments, the demands of so much decision-making quickly become too much for us. After about 40 minutes of shopping, most people stop struggling to be rationally selective, and instead began shopping emotionally―which is the point at which we accumulate the 50 percent of stuff in our cart that we never intended buying.

A new study suggests that contrary to most surveys. People art actually more stressed at home than at work. Researchers measured peoples cortntlol. Which is it at stress marker. While they were at work and while they were at home and found it higher at what is supposed to be a place of refuge.
Further contradicting conventional wisdom, we found that women as well as men have lower levels of stress at work than at home, writes one of the researchers. Sarah Damaske, In fact women say they feel better at work. She notes. it is men not women. Who report being bappicr at home than at work, Another surprise is that the findings hold true for both those with childrcn and without, but more so for nonparents. This is why pcoplc who work outside the home have better health.
What the study doesnt measure is whether people are still doing work when they re at home, whether it is household work or work brought home from the office. For many men, the end of the workday is a time to kick back. For women who stay home, they never get to leave the office. And for women who work outside the home, they often are playing catch-up-with-household tasks. With the blurring of roles, and the fact that the home front lags well behind the workplace in making adjustments for working women, it s not surprising that women are more stressed at home.
But its not just a gender thing. At work, people pretty much know what theyre supposed to be doing: working, making money, doing the tasks they have to do in order to draw an income. The bargain is very pure: Employee puts in hours of physical or mental labor and employee draws out life-sustaining moola.
On the home front, however, people have no such clarity. Rare is the household in which the division of labor is so clinically and methodically laid out. There are a lot of tasks to be done, there are inadequate rewards for most of them. Your home colleagues-your family-have no clear rewards for their labor; they need to be talked into it, or if they re teenagers, threatened with complete removal of all electronic devices. Plus, they re your family. You cannot fire your family. You never really get to go home from home.
So its not surprising that people are more stressed at home. Not only are the tasks apparently infinite, the co-workers are much harder to motivate.

[A]was an un realistic place for relaxation

For years, studies have found that first-generation college students-those who do not have a parent with a college degree-lag other students on a range of education achievement factors. Their grades are lower and their dropout rates are higher. But since such students are most likely to advance economically if they succeed in higher education, colleges and universities have pushed for decades to recruit more of them. This has created a dox in that recruiting first-generation students, but then watching many of them fail, means that higher education has continued to reproduce and widen, rather than close achievement gap based on social class, according to the depressing beginning of a paper forthcoming in the journal Psychological Sciense.
But the article is actually quite optimistic, as it outlines a potential solution to this problem, suggesting that an approach(which involves a one-hour, next-to-no-cost program) can close 63 percent of the achievement gap(measured by such factors as grades)between first-generation and other students.
The authors of the paper are from different universities, and their findins are based on a study involving 147 students(who completed the project)at an unnamed private unive rsity.First generation was defined as not having a parent with a fou r-year college degree Most of the first-generation students(59.1 percent) were recipients of Pell Grants，a federal g rant for undergraduates with financial need，while this was true only for 8.6 percent of the students wit at least one parent with a four-year degree
Their thesis-that a relatively modest inte rvention could have a big impact-was based on the view that first-gene ration students may be most lacking not in potential but in practical knowledge about how to deal with the issues that face most college students They cite past resea rch by several authors to show that this is the gap that must be na rrowed to close the achievement gap.
Many first-gene ration studentsstruggle to navigate the middle-class culture of higher education，learn therules of the game，and take advantage of college resou rces, they write And this becomes more of a problem when collages dont talk about the class advantage and disadvantages of different groups of students Because US colleges and universities seldom acknowledge how social class can affect students educational expe rience，many first-gene ration students lack sight about why they a re struggling and do not unde rstand how students like them can improve
26. Recruiting more first-generation students has
[A]reduced their d ropout rates
[B]narrowed the achievement gao
[C] missed its original pu rpose
[D]depressed college students
27 The author of the research article are optimistic because
[A]the problem is solvable
[B]their approach is costless
[q the recruiting rate has increased
[D]their finding appeal to students
28 The study suggests that most first-gene ration students
[A]study at private universities
[B]are from single-pa rent families
[q are in need of financial support
[D]have failed their collage
29. The author of the paper believe that first-generation students
[A]a re actually indifferent to the achievement gap
[B]can have a potential influence on othe r students
[C] may lack opportunities to apply for resea rch projects
[D]are inexperienced in handling their issues at college
30.We mayinfer from the last graph that
[A]universities often r~ect the culture of the middle-class
[B]students are usually to blame for their lack of resources
[C]social class g reatly helps en rich educational experiences
[D]colleges are partly responsible for the problem in question

Even in traditional offices，the lingua franca of corporate America has gottenmuch more emotional and much more right-brained than it was 20 years ago， said Ha rva rd Business School professor Nancy Koehn She sta rted spinning off examples.If you and I pa rachuted back to Fortune 500 companies in 1990，we would see much less frequent use of terms like Journey, mission,passion. There were goals，there were strategies，there were tives，but we didnt talk about energy；we didnt talk about passion.
Koehn pointed out that this new era of corporate vocabula ry is very team-oriented-and not by coincidence.Lets not forget sDorts-in male-dominated corporate America，its still a big deal. Its not explicitly conscious；its the idea that Im a coach，and youre my team，and were in this togethec. There are lots and lots of CEOs in very different companies，but most think of themselves as coaches and this is their team and they want to win.
These terms a re also intended to infuse work with meaning-and，as Khu rana points out，increase allegiance to the firm.You have the importation of terminology that historically used to be associated with non-profit organizations and religious organizations：Terms like vision，values，passion，and purpose，saidKhurana
This new focus on personal fulfillment can help keep employees motivated amid increasingly loud debates over work-life balance The mommy wars of the 1990s a re still going on today, prompting arguments about whywomen still canthave it all and books like Sheryl Sandbergs Lean In，whose title has become abuzzword in its own right. Terms like unplug，offline，life-hack，bandwidth，andcapacity are all about setting boundaries between the office and the home But ifyour work is your passion, youII be more likely to devote yourself to it，even ifthat means going home for dinner and then working long after the kids are in bed
But this seems to be the irony of office speak：Everyone makes fun of it，butmanage rs love it，companies depend on it，and regular people willingly absorb itAs Nunberg said，You can get people to think its nonsense at the same timethat you buy into it. In a workplace thats fundamentally indiffe rent to your lifeand its meaning office speak can help you figu re out how you relate to yourwork-and how your work defines who you are
31. According to Nancy Koehn, office language has become
[A]more e motional
[B]more tive
[C]less energetic
[D]less energetic
[E]less strategic
32.team-oriented corporate vocabulary is closely related to
[A]historical incidents
[B]gender difference
[C]sports culture
[D]athletic executives
33.Khurana believes that the importation of terminology aims to
[A]revive historical terms
[B]promote company image
[C]foster corporate cooperation
[D]strengthen employee loyalty
34.It can be inferred that Lean In
[A]voices for working women
[B]appeals to passionate workaholics
[C]triggers dcbates among mommies
[D]praises motivated employees
35.Which of the following statements is true about office speak?
[A]Managers admire it but avoid it
[B]Linguists believe it to be nonsense
[C]Companies find it to be fundamental
[D]Regular people mock it but accept it

Many people talked of the 288,000 new jobs the Labor Department reporled for Jure, along with the drop in the unemployment take to 6 J percent. at good news. And they were right. For now it appears the economy is creating jobs at a decent pace. We still have a long way to go to get back to full employment, but at least we are now finally moving forward at a faster pace.
However there is another important part of the jobs picture that was targely ovedookcd. There was a big jump in the number of people who report voluntarily working part-time. This figure is now 830,000（4,4 percent）above its year ago level.
Before explaining the connection to the Obamacare, it is worth making an important distinction. Many people who work part-time jobs actually want full-time jobs. They take part-time work because this is all they can get. An increase in involuntary part-time work is evidence of weakness in the labor market and it means that many people will be having a very hard time making ends meet.
There was an increase in involuntary part-time in June, but the general direction has been down. Involuntary part-time employment is still far higher than before the recession, but it is down by 640,000(7.9 percent)from its year ago level.
We know the difference between voluntary and involuntary part-time employment because people tell us. The survey used by the Labor Department asks people if they worked less than 35 hours in the reference week. If the answer is yes.they are classified as working part-time. The survey then asks whether they worked less than 35 hours in that week because they wanted to work less than full time or because they had no choice. They are only elassified as voluntary part-time workers if they tell the survey taker they chose to work less than 35 hours a week.
The issue of voluntary part-time relates to Obamacare becanse one of the main purposes was to allow people to get insurance outside of employment. For many people, especially those with serious health conditions or family mrs with serious health conditions, before Obamacare the only way to get insurance was through a job that provided health insurance.
However, Obamacare has allowed more than 12 million people to either get insurance through Medicaid or the exchanges. These are people who may previously have felt the need to get a full-time job that provided insurance in order to cover themselves and their families. With Obamacare there is no longer a link between employment and insurance.
36. Which part of the jobs picture was neglected?
A. The prospect of a thriving job market.
B. The increase of voluntary part-time jobs.
C. The possibility of full employment.
D. The acceleration of job creation.
37. Many people work part-time because they
A. prefer part-time jobs to full-time jobs
B. feel that is enough to make ends meet
C. cannot get their hands on full-time jobs
D. haven t seen the weakness of the market
38. Involuntary part-time employment in the US
A. is harder to acquire than one year ago
B. shows a general tendency of decline
C. satisfies the real need of the jobless
D. is lower than before the recession
39. It can be learned that with Obamacare, .
A. it is no longer easy for part-timers to get insurance
B. employment is no longer a precondition to get insurance
C. it is still challenging to get insurance for family mrs
D. full-time employment is still essential for insurance
40. The text mainly discusses.
A. employment in the US
B. part-timer classification
C. insurance through Medicaid
D. Obamacares trouble
Some Old Truths to Help You Overcorne Toucgh Times
Uefortunately, life is not a bed of roses, We are going through life facing sad experiences. Moreover, we are grieving various kinds of loss: a friendship, a rontantic relatlonshlp of a house. Hard times may hold you down at what usually seems like the most inopportune time,but you should remr that they wont last forever.
When our time of mourning is over, we press forward, stronger with a greater understanding and respect for life. Furthermore, these losses make us mature and eventally move as toward future opportunities for growth and happiness. I want to share these old truths Ive learned along the way.
41.
Fear is both useful and harmful. This normal human reaction is used to protect us by signaling danger and preparing us to deal with it. Unfortunately, people create inner barriers with a help of exaggerating fears. My favorite actor will smith once said, Fear is not real. It is a product of thoughts you create. Do not misunderstand me. Danger is very real. But fear is a choice. I do completely agree that fears are just the product of our luxuriant imagination.
42 .
If you are by and
43. .
Sometimes it is casy to feel bad because you are going through tough times. You can be easily caught up by life problems that you forget to pause and appreciate the things you have. Only strong people prefer to smile and value their life instead of crying and complaining about something.
44..
No matter how isolated you might feel and how serious the situation is, you should always remr that you are not alone. Try to keep in mind that almost everyone respects and wants to help you if you are trying to make a good change in your life, especially your dearest and nearest people, You may have a circle of friends who provide constant good humor, help and companionship. If you have no friends or relatives. Try to participate in several online communities, full of people who are always willing to share advice and cncouragement.
45 .
Today many people find it difficult to trust their own opinion and seek balance by gaining tivity from external sources. This way you devalue your opinion and show that you are incapable of managing your of own life. When you are struggling to achieve something important you should believe in yourself and be sure that your decision is the best. You live in your skin, think your own thoughts, have your own values and make your own choices.

Translate the following text from English into Chinese. Write your translation on ANSWER SHEET 2. (15 points)
Think about driving a route thats very familiar. It could be your commute to work, a trip into town or the way home. Whichever it is, you know every twist and turn like the back of your hand. On these sorts of trips its easy tolose concentration on the driving and pay little attention to the passing scenery. The consequence is that you perceive that the trip has taken less time than it actually has.
This is the well-travelled road effect: people tend to underestimate the time it takes to travel a familiar route.
The effect is caused by the way we allocate our attention. When we travel down a well-known route, because we dont have to concentrate much, time seems to flow more quickly. And afterwards, when we come to think back on it, we cant remr the journey well because we didnt pay much attention to it. So we assume it wasshorter.

　　What would you do with 590m? This is now a question for GloriaMackenzie, an 84-year-old widow who recently emerged from hersmall, tin-roofed house in Florida to collect the biggest undividedlottery jackpot in history. If she hopes her new-found for tunewill yield lasting feelings of fulfillment, she could do worse thanread Happy Money by Elizabeth Dumn and Michael Norton.
　　These two academics use an array of behavioral research to showthat the most rewarding ways to spend money can becounterintuitive. Fantasies of great wealth often involve visionsof fancy cars and extravagant homes. Yet satisfaction with thesematerial purchases wears off fairly quickly what was once excitingand new becomes old-hat; regret creeps in. It is far better tospend money on experiences, say Ms Dumn and Mr Norton, likeinteresting trips, unique meals or even going to the cinema. Thesepurchases often become more valuable with time-as stories ormemories-particularly if they involve feeling more connected toothers.
　　This slim volume is packed with tips to help wage slaves as wellas lottery winners get the most "happiness bang for your buck." Itseems most people would be better off if they could shorten theircommutes to work, spend more time with friends and family and lessof it watching television (something the average American spends awhopping two months a year doing, and is hardly jollier forit).Buying gifts or giving to charity is often more pleasurablethan purchasing things for oneself, and luxuries are most enjoyablewhen they are consumed sparingly. This is apparently the reasonMacDonald's restricts the availability of its popular McRib - amarketing trick that has turned the pork sandwich into an object ofobsession.
　　Readers of “HappyMoney” are clearly a privileged lot, anxiousabout fulfillment, not hunger.Money may not quite buy happiness,but people in wealthier countries are generally happier than thosein poor ones. Yet the link between feeling good and spending moneyon others can be seen among rich and poor people around the world,and scarcity enhances the pleasure of most things for most people.Not everyone will agree with the authors’ policy ideas, which rangefrom mandating more holiday time to reducing tax incentives forAmerican homebuyers. But most people will come away from this bookbelieving it was money well spent。
　　21.According to Dumn and Norton,which of the following is themost rewarding purchase?
　　[A]A big house
　　[B]A special tour
　　[C]A stylish car
　　[D]A rich meal
　　22.The author’s attitude toward Americans’ watching TV is
　　[A]critical
　　[B]supportive
　　[C]sympathetic
　　[D]ambiguous
　　23.Macrib is mentioned in paragraph 3 to show that
　　[A]consumers are sometimes irrational
　　[B]popularity usually comes after quality
　　[C]marketing tricks are after effective
　　[D]rarity generally increases pleasure
　　24.According to the last paragraph,Happy Money
　　[A]has left much room for readers’criticism
　　[B]may prove to be a worthwhile purchase
　　[C]has predicted a wider income gap in the us
　　[D]may give its readers a sense of achievement
　　25.This text mainly discusses how to
　　[A]balance feeling good and spending money
　　[B]spend large sums of money won in lotteries
　　[C]obtain lasting satisfaction from money spent
　　[D]become more reasonable in spending on luxuries

　　An article in Scientific America has pointed out that empiricalresearch says that, actually, you think you’re more beautiful thanyou are. We have a deep-seated need to feel good about ourselvesand we naturally employ a number of self-enhancing strategies toresearch into what the call the “above average effect”, or“illusory superiority”, and shown that, for example, 70% of us rateourselves as above average in leadership, 93% in driving and 85% atgetting on well with others―all obviously statisticalimpossibilities.
　　We rose tint our memories and put ourselves into self-affirmingsituations. We become defensive when criticized, and apply negativestereotypes to others to boost our own esteem, we stalk aroundthinking we’re hot stuff.
　　Psychologist and behavioral scientist Nicholas Epley oversaw akey studying into self-enhancement and attractiveness. Rather thathave people simply rate their beauty compress with others, he askedthem to identify an original photogragh of themselves’ from alineup including versions that had been altered to appear more andless attractive. Visual recognition, reads the study, is “anautomatic psychological process occurring rapidly and intuitivelywith little or no apparent conscious deliberation”. If the subjectsquickly chose a falsely flattering image- which must did- theygenuinely believed it was really how they looked. Epley found nosignificant gender difference in responses. Nor was there anyevidence that, those who self-enhance the must (that is, theparticipants who thought the most positively doctored picture werereal) were doing so to make up for profound insecurities. In factthose who thought that the images higher up the attractivenessscale were real directly corresponded with those who showed othermakers for having higher self-esteem. “I don’t think the findingsthat we having have are any evidence of personal delusion”, saysEpley. “It’s a reflection simply of people generally thinking wellof themselves’. If you are depressed, you won’t be self-enhancing.Knowing the results of Epley ‘s study,it makes sense that whypeople heat photographs of themselves Viscerally-on one level, theydon’t even recognise the person in the picture as themselves,Facebook therefore ,is a self-enhancer’s paradise,where people canshare only the most flattering photos, the cream of their wit,style ,beauty, intellect and lifestyle it’s not that people’sprofiles are dishonest,says catalina toma of Wiscon―Madisonuniversity ,”but they portray an idealized version ofthemselves.
　　26. According to the first paragraph, social psychologist havefound that ______.
　　[A] our self-ratings are unrealistically high
　　[B] illusory superiority is baseless effect
　　[C] our need for leadership is unnatural
　　[D] self-enhancing strategies are ineffective

　　When the government talks about infrastructure contributing tothe economy the focus is usually on roads, railways, broadband andenergy. Housing is seldom mentioned.
　　Why is that? To some extent the housing sector must shoulder theblame. We have not been good at communicating the real value thathousing can contribute to economic growth. Then there is the scaleof the typical housing project. It is hard to shove for attentionamong multibillion-pound infrastructure project, so it isinevitable that the attention is focused elsewhere. But perhaps themost significant reason is that the issue has always been sopolitically charged.
　　Nevertheless, the affordable housing situation is desperate.Waiting lists increase all the time and we are simply not buildingenough new homes.
　　The comprehensive spending review offers an opportunity for thegovernment to help rectify this. It needs to put historicalprejudices to one side and take some steps to address our urgenthousing need.
　　There are some indications that it is preparing to do just that.The communities minister, Don Foster, has hinted that GeorgeOsborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer, may introduce moreflexibility to the current cap on the amount that local authoritiescan borrow against their housing stock debt. Evidence shows that60,000 extra new homes could be built over the next five years ifthe cap were lifted, increasing GDP by 0.6%.
　　Ministers should also look at creating greater certainty in therental environment, which would have a significant impact on theability of registered providers to fund new developments fromrevenues.
　　But it is not just down to the government. While these measureswould be welcome in the short term, we must face up to the factthat the existing &pound;4.5bn programme of grants to fund newaffordable housing, set to expire in 2015,is unlikely to beextended beyond then. The Labour party has recently announced thatit will retain a large part of the coalition’s spending plans ifreturns to power. The housing sector needs to accept that we arevery unlikely to ever return to era of large-scale public grants.We need to adjust to this changing climate.
　　36. The author believes that the housing sector__
　　[A] has attracted much attention
　　[B] involves certain political factors
　　[C] shoulders too much responsibility
　　[D] has lost its real value in economy
　　37. It can be learned that affordable housing has__
　　[A] increased its home supply
　　[B] offered spending opportunities
　　[C] suffered government biases
　　[D] disappointed the government
　　38. According to Paragraph 5,George Osborne may_______.
　　[A] allow greater government debt for housing
　　[B] stop local authorities from building homes
　　[C] prepare to reduce housing stock debt
　　[D] release a lifted GDP growth forecast
　　39.It can be inferred that a stable rental environmentwould_______.

　　[B]lessen the impact of government interference
　　[C]contribute to funding new developments
　　[D]relieve the ministers of responsibilities

But that’s exactly the kind offalse deerfulness that positive psychologists wouldn’t recommend.“Healthy optimists means being in touch with reality.” says TalBen-Shahar, a Harvard professor, According to Ben- Shalar,realisticoptimists are these who make the best of things that happen, butnot those who believe everything happens for the best.
　　Ben-Shalar uses three optimistic exercisers. When he feelsdown-sag, after giving a bad lecture-he grants himself permissionto be human.

　　Given the advantages of electronic money, you might think that we would move quickly to the cashless society in which all payments are made electronically.  1  a true cashless society is probably not around the corner. Indeed, predictions have been  2  for two decades but have not yet come to fruition. For example, Business Week predicted in 1975 that electronic means of payment would soon "revolutionize the very  3  of money itself," only to  4  itself several years later. Why has the movement to a cashless society been so  5  in coming?

　　Although electronic means of payment may be more efficient than a payments system based on paper, several factors work  6  the disappearance of the paper system. First, it is very  7  to set up the computer, card reader, and telecornmunications networks necessary to make electronic money the  8  form of payment Second, paper checks have the advantage that they  9  receipts, something thai many consumers are unwilling to  10  . Third, the use of paper checks gives consumers several days of "float" - it takes several days  11  a check is cashed and funds are  12  from the issuer's account, which means that the writer of the check can cam interest on the funds in the meantime.  13  electronic payments arc immediate, they eliminate the float for the consumer. 

　　Fourth, electronic means of payment may  14  security and privacy concerns. We often hear media reports that an unauthorized hacker has been able to access a computer database and to alter information  15  there. The fact that this is not an 16 occurrence means that dishonest persons might be able to access bank accounts in electronic payments systems and  17  from someone else's accounts. The  18  of this type of fraud is no easy task, and a new field of computer science is developing to 19  security issues.

　　Directions:
　　Read the following four texts. Answer the questions below each text by choosing A, B, C or D. Mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET 1. (40 points)

　　Text 1

　　In an essay entitled “Making It in America”, the author Adam Davidson relates a joke from cotton about just how much a modern textile mill has been automated: The average mill only two employees today,” a man and a dog. The man is there to feed the dog is there to keep the man away from the machines.”

　　Davidson’s article is one of a number of pieces that have recently appeared making the point that the reason we have such stubbornly high unemployment and declining middle-class incomes today is also because of the advances in both globalization and the information technology revolution, which are more rapidly than ever replacing labor with machines or foreign worker.

　　In the past, workers with average skills, doing an average job，could earn an average lifestyle ,But ,today ,average is officially over. Being average just won’t earn you what it used to. It can’t when so many more employers have so much more access to so much more above average cheap foreign labor, cheap robotics, cheap software, cheap automation and cheap genius. Therefore, everyone needs to find their extra-their unique value contribution that makes them stand out in whatever is their field of employment.

　　Yes, new technology has been eating jobs forever, and always will. But there’s been an acceleration. As Davidson notes,” In the 10 years ending in 2009, [U.S.] factories shed workers so fast that they erased almost all the gains of the previous 70 years; roughly one out of every three manufacturing jobs-about 6 million in total -disappeared.

　　There will always be changed-new jobs, new products, new services. But the one thing we know for sure is that with each advance in globalization and the I.T. revolution, the best jobs will require workers to have more and better education to make themselves above average.

　　In a world where average is officially over, there are many things we need to do to support employment, but nothing would be more important than passing some kind of G.I.Bill for the 21st century that ensures that every American has access to poet-high school education.

　　21. The joke in Paragraph 1 is used to illustrate_______
　　[A] the impact of technological advances
　　[B] the alleviation of job pressure
　　[C] the shrinkage of textile mills
　　[D] the decline of middle-class incomes
　　22. According to Paragraph 3, to be a successful employee, one has to______
　　[A] work on cheap software

　　[B] ask for a moderate salary
　　[C] adopt an average lifestyle
　　[D] contribute something unique

　　23. The quotation in Paragraph 4 explains that ______
　　[A] gains of technology have been erased
　　[B] job opportunities are disappearing at a high speed
　　[C] factories are making much less money than before
　　[D] new jobs and services have been offered

　　24. According to the author, to reduce unemployment, the most important is_____
　　[A] to accelerate the I.T. revolution
　　[B] to ensure more education for people
　　[C] ro advance economic globalization
[D] to pass more bills in the 21st century

　　25. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the text?
　　[A] New Law Takes Effect
　　[B] Technology Goes Cheap
　　[C] Average Is Over
　　[D] Recession Is Bad

　　Text 2
　　A century ago, the immigrants from across the Atlantic inclued settlers and sojourners. Along with the many folks looking to make a permanent home in the United States came those who had no intention to stay, and 7millin people arrived while about 2 million departed. About a quarter of all Italian immigrants, for exanmle, eventually returned to Italy for good. They even had an affectionate nickname, “uccelli di passaggio,” birds of passage.

　　Today, we are much more rigid about immigrants. We divide nemcomers into two categories: legal or illegal, good or bad. We hail them as Americans in the making, or our broken immigrantion system and the long political paralysis over how to fix it. We don’t need more categories, but we need to change the way we think about categories. We need to look beyond strick definitions of legal and illegal. To start, we can recognize the new birds of passage, those living and thriving in the gray areas. We might then begin to solve our immigration challenges.

　　Crop pickers, violinists, construction workers, entrepreneurs, engineers, home health-care aides and physicists are among today’s birds of passage. They are energetic participants in a global economy driven by the flow of work, money and ideas .They prefer to come and go as opportunity calls them , They can manage to have a job in one place and a family in another.

　　With or without permission, they straddle laws, jurisdictions and identities with ease. We need them to imagine the United States as a place where they can be productive for a while without committing themselves to staying forever. We need them to feel that home can be both here and there and that they can belong to two nations honorably.

　　Accommodating this new world of people in motion will require new attitudes on both sides of the immigration battle .Looking beyond the culture war logic of right or wrong means opening up the middle ground and understanding that managing immigration today requires multiple paths and multiple outcomes. Including some that are not easy to accomplish legally in the existing system.

　　26 “Birds of passage” refers to those who____

　　[A] immigrate across the Atlantic.
　　[B] leave their home countries for good.
　　[C] stay in a foregin temporaily.
　[D] find permanent jobs overseas.

　　27 It is implied in paragraph 2 that the current immigration stystem in the US____

　　[A] needs new immigrant categories.
　　[B] has loosened control over immigrants.
　　[C] should be adopted to meet challenges.
　　[D] has been fixeed via political means.

　　28 According to the author, today’s birds of passage want___

　　[A] fiancial incentives.
　　[B] a global recognition.
　[C] opportunities to get regular jobs.
　[D] the freedom to stay and leave.

　29 The author suggests that the birds of passage today should be treated __
[A] as faithful partners.
　　[B] with economic favors.
　　[C] with regal tolerance.
　　[D] as mighty rivals.

　　Scientists have found that although we are prone to snap overreactions, if we take a moment and think about how we are likely to react, we can reduce or even eliminate the negative effects of our quick, hard-wired responses.

　　Snap decisions can be important defense mechanisms; if we are judging whether someone is dangerous, our brains and bodies are hard-wired to react very quickly, within milliseconds. But we need more time to assess other factors. To accurately tell whether someone is sociable, studies show, we need at least a minute, preferably five. It takes a while to judge complex aspects of personality, like neuroticism or open-mindedness.

　　But snap decisions in reaction to rapid stimuli aren’t exclusive to the interpersonal realm. Psychologists at the University of Toronto found that viewing a fast-food logo for just a few milliseconds primes us to read 20 percent faster, even though reading has little to do with eating. We unconsciously associate fast food with speed and impatience and carry those impulses into whatever else we’re doing, Subjects exposed to fast-food flashes also tend to think a musical piece lasts too long.

　　Yet we can reverse such influences. If we know we will overreact to consumer products or housing options when we see a happy face (one reason good sales representatives and real estate agents are always smiling), we can take a moment before buying. If we know female job screeners are more likely to reject attractive female applicants, we can help screeners understand their biases-or hire outside screeners.

　　John Gottman, the marriage expert, explains that we quickly “thin slice” information reliably only after we ground such snap reactions in “thick sliced” long-term study. When Dr. Gottman really wants to assess whether a couple will stay together, he invites them to his island retreat for a muck longer evaluation; two days, not two seconds.

　　Our ability to mute our hard-wired reactions by pausing is what differentiates us from animals: doge can think about the future only intermittently or for a few minutes. But historically we have spent about 12 percent of our days contemplating the longer term. Although technology might change the way we react, it hasn’t changed our nature. We still have the imaginative capacity to rise above temptation and reverse the high-speed trend.

　　31. The time needed in making decisions may____.
　　[A] vary according to the urgency of the situation
　　[B] prove the complexity of our brain reaction
　　[C] depend on the importance of the assessment

　　[D] predetermine the accuracy of our judgment
　　32. Our reaction to a fast-food logo shows that snao decisions____.
　　[A] can be associative
　　[B] are not unconscious
　　[C] can be dangerous
　　[D] are not impulsive
　　33. Toreverse the negative influences of snap decisions,we should____.
　　[A] trust our first impression
　　[B] do as people usually do
　　[C] think before we act
　　[D] ask for expert advice
　　34. John Gottman says that reliable snap reaction are based on____.
　　[A] critical assessment
　　[B]‘‘thin sliced ’’study
　　[C] sensible explanation
　　[D] adequate information

　　35. The author’s attitude toward reversing the high-speed trend is____.
　　[A] tolerant
　　[B] uncertain
　　[C] optimistic
　　[D] doubtful

　　Europe is not a gender-equality heaven.In particular, the corporate workplace will never be completely family―friendly until women are part of senior management decisions,and Europe,s top corporate-governance positions remain overwhelmingly male .indeed,women hold only 14 percent of positions on Europe corporate boards.

　　The Europe Union is now considering legislation to compel corporate boards to maintain a certain proportion of women-up to 60 percent.This proposed mandate was born of frustration. Last year, Europe Commission Vice President Viviane Reding issued a call to voluntary action. Reding invited corporations to sign up for gender balance goal of 40 percent female board membership. But her appeal was considered a failure: only 24 companies took it up.

　　Do we need quotas to ensure that women can continue to climb the corporate Ladder fairy as they balance work and family?

　　“Personally, I don’t like quotas,” Reding said recently. “But i like what the quotas do.” Quotas get action: they “open the way to equality and they break through the glass ceiling,” according to Reding, a result seen in France and other countries with legally binding provisions on placing women in top business positions.

　　I understand Reding’s reluctance-and her frustration. I don’t like quotas either; they run counter to my belief in meritocracy, government by the capable. Bur, when one considers the obstacles to achieving the meritocratic ideal, it does look as if a fairer world must be temporarily ordered.

　　After all, four decades of evidence has now shown that corporations in Europe as the US are evading the meritocratic hiring and promotion of women to top position― no matter how much “soft pressure ” is put upon them. When women do break through to the summit of  corporate power--as, for example, Sheryl Sandberg recently did at Facebook―they attract massive attention precisely because they remain the exception to the rule.

　　If appropriate pubic policies were in place to help all women---whether CEOs or their children’s caregivers--and all families, Sandberg would be no more newsworthy than any other highly capable person living in a more just society.

　　36. In the European corporate workplace, generally_____.
　　[A] women take the lead
　　[B] men have the final say
　　[C] corporate governance is overwhelmed
　　[D] senior management is family-friendly
　　37. The European Union’s intended legislation is ________.

　　[A] a reflection of gender balance
　　[B] a reluctant choice
　　[C] a response to Reding’s call
　　[D] a voluntary action
　　38. According ti Reding, quotas may help women ______.
　　[A] get top business positions
　　[B] see through the glass ceiling
　　[C] balance work and family
　　[D] anticipate legal results
　　39. The author’s attitude toward Reding’s appeal is one of _________.
　　[A] skepticism
　　[B] objectiveness
　　[C] indifference
　　[D] approval
　　40. Women entering top management become headlines due to the lack of ______.

　　[B] massive media attention
　　[C] suitable public policies
　　[D] greater “soft pressure”

　　The hugely popular blog the Skint Foodie chronicles how Tony balances his love of good food with living on benefits. After bills, Tony has ?60 a week to spend, ?40 of which goes on food, but 10 years ago he was earning ?130,000 a I year working in corporate communications and eating at London's betft restaurants'" at least twice a week. Then his marriage failed, his career burned out and his drinking became serious. "The community mental health team saved my life. And I felt like that again, to a certain degree, when people responded to the blog so well. It gave me the validation and confidence that I'd lost. But it's still a day-by-day thing." Now he's living in a council flat and fielding offers from literary agents. He's feeling positive, but he'll carry on blogging - not about eating as cheaply as you can - "there are so many people in a much worse state, with barely any money to spend on food" - but eating well on a budget. Here's his advice for economical foodies.41._____________________Impulsive spending isn't an option, so plan your week's menu in advance, making shopping lists for your ingredients in their exact quantities. I have an Excel template for a week of breakfast, lunch and dinner. Stop laughing: it's not just cost effective but helps you balance your diet. It's also a good idea to shop daily instead of weekly, because, being-human, you'll sometimes change your mind about what you　fancy.

　　42____________________________________________________________

　　This is where supermarkets and thci; anonymity come in handy. With them,　there's not the same embarrassment as when buying one carrot in a little　greengrocer. And if you plan properly, you'll know that you only need, say, 350g　of shin of beef and six rashers of bacon, not whatever weight is pre-packed in the　supermarket chiller.

　　43_________

　　You may proudly claim to only have frozen peas in the freezer - that's not　good enough. Mine is filled with leftovers, bread, stock, meat and fish. Planning　ahead should eliminate wastage, but if you have surplus vegetables you'll do a　vegetable soup, and all fruits threatening to "go off' will be cooked or juiced.44___________________________________

　　Everyone says this, but it really is a top tip for frugal eaters. Shop at butchers,　delis and fish-sellers regularly, even for small things, and be super friendly. Soon　you'll feel comfortable asking if they've any knuckles of ham for soups and stews,　or beef bones, chicken carcasses and fish heads for stock which, more often than　not, Theyil let you have for free.

　　45__________________

　　You won't be eating out a lot, but save your pennies and once every fewmonths treat yourself to a set lunch at a good restaurant - ?1.75 a week for three　months gives you ?21 - more than" enough for a three-course lunch atMichelin-starred Arbutus. It's ?16.95 there - or ?12.99 for a large pizza from　Domino's: I know which I'd rather eat.

　　Homework has never been terribly popular with students and even many parents, but in recent years it has been particularly scorned. School districts across the country, most recently Los Angeles Unified, are revising their thinking on his educational ritual. Unfortunately, L.A. Unified has produced an inflexible policy which mandates that with the exception of some advanced courses, homework may no longer count for more than 10% of a student’s academic grade.
 
　　This rule is meant to address the difficulty that students from impoverished or chaotic homes might have in completing their homework. But the policy is unclear and contradictory. Certainly, no homework should be assigned that students cannot do without expensive equipment. But if the district is essentially giving a pass to students who do not do their homework because of complicated family lives, it is going riskily close to the implication that standards need to be lowered for poor children.
 
　　District administrators say that homework will still be a pat of schooling: teachers are allowed to assign as much of it as they want. But with homework counting for no more than 10% of their grades, students can easily skip half their homework and see vey little difference on their report cards. Some students might do well on state tests without completing their homework, but what about the students who performed well on the tests and did their homework? It is quite possible that the homework helped. Yet rather than empowering teachers to find what works best for their students, the policy imposes a flat, across-the-board rule.
 
　　At the same time, the policy addresses none of the truly thorny questions about homework. If the district finds homework to be unimportant to its students’ academic achievement, it should move to reduce or eliminate the assignments, not make them count for almost nothing. Conversely, if homework does nothing to ensure that the homework students are not assigning more than they are willing to review and correct.
 
　　The homework rules should be put on hold while the school board, which is responsible for setting educational policy, looks into the matter and conducts public hearings. It is not too late for L.A. Unified to do homework right.
 
　　21.It is implied in paragraph 1 that nowadays homework_____.
　　[A] is receiving more criticism
　　[B]is no longer an educational ritual
　　[C]is not required for advanced courses
　　[D]is gaining more preferences
　　22.L.A.Unified has made the rule about homework mainly because poor students_____.
　　[A]tend to have moderate expectations for their education
　　[B]have asked for a different educational standard
　　[C]may have problems finishing their homework
　　[D]have voiced their complaints about homework
　　23.According to Paragraph 3,one problem with the policy is that it may____.
　　[A]discourage students from doing homework
　　[B]result in students' indifference to their report cards
　　[C]undermine the authority of state tests
　　[D]restrict teachers' power in education
　　24. As mentioned in Paragraph 4, a key question unanswered about homework is whether______. [A] it should be eliminated
　　[B]it counts much in schooling
　　[C]it places extra burdens on teachers
　　[D]it is important for grades
　　25.A suitable title for this text could be______.
　　[A]Wrong Interpretation of an Educational Policy
　　[B]A Welcomed Policy for Poor Students
　　[C]Thorny Questions about Homework
　　[D]A Faulty Approach to Homework

　　Pretty in pink: adult women do not rememer being so obsessed with the colour, yet it is pervasive in our young girls’ lives. Tt is not that pink is intrinsically bad, but it is such a tiny slice of the rainbow and, though it may celebrate girlhood in one way, it also repeatedly and firmly fuses girls’ identity to appearance. Then it presents that connection, even among two-year-olds, between girls as not only innocent but as evidence of innocence. Looking around, I despaired at the singular lack of imagination about girls’ lives and interests.
 
　　Girls’ attraction to pink may seem unavoidable, somehow encoded in their DNA, but according to Jo Paoletti, an associate professor of American Studies, it is not. Children were not colour-coded at all until the early 20th century: in the era before domestic washing machines all babies wore white as a practical matter, since the only way of getting clothes clean was to boil them. What’s more, both boys and girls wore what were thought of as gender-neutral dresses.When nursery colours were introduced, pink was actually considered the more masculine colour, a pastel version of red, which was associated with strength. Blue, with its intimations of the Virgin Mary, constancy and faithfulness, symbolised femininity. It was not until the mid-1980s, when amplifying age and sex differences became a dominant children’s marketing strategy, that pink fully came into its own, 
when it began to seem inherently attractive to girls, part of what defined them as female, at least for the first few critical years.
 
　　I had not realised how profoundly marketing trends dictated our perception of what is natural to kins, including our core beliefs about their psychological development. Take the toddler. I assumed that phase was something experts developed after years of research into children’s behaviour: wrong. Turns out, acdording to Daniel Cook, a historian of childhood consumerism, it was popularised as a marketing trick by clothing manufacrurers in the 1930s.
 
　　Trade publications counselled department stores that, in order to increase sales, they should create a “third stepping stone” between infant wear and older kids’ clothes. Tt was only after “toddler”became a common shoppers’ term that it evolved into a broadly accepted developmental stage. Splitting kids, or adults,into ever-tinier categories has proved a sure-fire way to boost profits. And one of the easiest ways to segment a market is to magnify gender differences C or invent them where they did not previously exist.
 
　　26.By saying "it is...the rainbow"(Line 3, Para.1),the author means pink______.
　　[A]should not be the sole representation of girlhood
　　[B]should not be associated with girls' innocence
　　[C]cannot explain girls' lack of imagination
　　[D]cannot influence girls' lives and interests
 
　　27.According to Paragraph 2, which of the following is true of colours?
　　[A]Colours are encoded in girls' DNA.
　　[B]Blue used to be regarded as the colour for girls.
　　[C]Pink used to be a neutral colour in symbolising genders.
　　[D]White is prefered by babies.
 
　　28.The author suggests that our perception of children's psychological development was much influenced by_____.
　　[A]the marketing of products for children
　　[B]the observation of children's nature
　　[C]researches into children's behavior
　　[D]studies of childhood consumption
 
　　29.We may learn from Paragraph 4 that department stores were advised to_____.
　　[A]focus on infant wear and older kids' clothes
　　[B]attach equal importance to different genders
　　[C]classify consumers into smaller groups
　　[D]create some common shoppers' terms
 
　　30.It can be concluded that girls' attraction to pink seems to be____.
　　[A] clearly explained by their inborn tendency
　　[B]fully understood by clothing manufacturers
　　[C] mainly imposed by profit-driven businessmen
　　[D]well interpreted by psychological experts

　　The great recession may be over, but this era of high joblessness is probably beginning. Before it ends,it will likely change the life course and character of a generation of young adults. And ultimately, it is likely to reshape our politics,our culture, and the character of our society for years.
 
　　No one tries harder than the jobless to find silver linings in this national economic disaster. Many said that unemployment, while extremely painful, had improved them in some ways; they had become less materialistic and more financially prudent; they were more aware of the struggles of others. In limited respects, perhaps the recession will leave society better off. At the very least, it has awoken us from our national fever dream of easy riches and bigger houses, and put a necessary end to an era of reckless personal spending.
 
　　But for the most part, these benefits seem thin, uncertain, and far off. In The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth, the economic historian Benjamin Friedman argues that both inside and outside the U.S. ,lengthy periods of economic stagnation or decline have almost always left society more mean-spirited and less inclusive, and have usually stopped or reversed the advance of rights and freedoms. Anti-immigrant sentiment typically increases, as does conflict between races and classes.
 
　　Income inequality usually falls during a recession, but it has not shrunk in this one,. Indeed, this period of economic weakness may reinforce class divides, and decrease opportunities to cross them--- especially for young people. The research of Till Von Wachter, the economist in Columbia University, suggests that not all people graduating into a recession see their life chances dimmed: those with degrees from elite universities catch up fairly quickly to where they otherwise would have been if they had graduated in better times; it is the masses beneath them that are left behind.
 
　　In the internet age, it is particularly easy to see the resentment that has always been hidden winthin American society. More difficult, in the moment , is discerning precisely how these lean times are affecting society’s character. In many respects, the U.S. was more socially tolerant entering this resession than at any time in its history, and a variety of national polls on social conflict since then have shown mixed results. We will have to wait and see exactly how these hard times will reshape our social fabric. But they certainly it, and all the more so the longer they extend.
 
　　36.By saying “to find silver linings”(Line 1,Para.2)the author suggest that the jobless try to___.
　　[A]seek subsidies from the govemment
　　[B]explore reasons for the unermployment
　　[C]make profits from the troubled economy
　　[D]look on the bright side of the recession
 
　　37.According to Paragraph 2,the recession has made people_____.
　　[A]realize the national dream
　　[B]struggle against each other
　　[C]challenge their lifestyle
　　[D]reconsider their lifestyle
 
　　38.Benjamin Friedman believe that economic recessions may_____.
　　[A]impose a heavier burden on immigrants
　　[B]bring out more evils of human nature
　　[C]Promote the advance of rights and freedoms
　　[D]ease conflicts between races and classes
 
　　39.The research of Till Von Wachther suggests that in recession graduates from elite universities tend to _____.
　　[A]lag behind the others due to decreased opportunities
　　[B]catch up quickly with experienced employees
　　[C]see their life chances as dimmed as the others’
　　[D]recover more quickly than the others

　　“Universal history, the history of what man has accomplished in this world, is at bottom the History of the Great Men who have worked here,” wrote the Victorian sage Thomas Carlyle. Well, not any more it is not.
 
　　Suddenly, Britain looks to have fallen out with its favourite historical form. This could be no more than a passing literary craze, but it also points to a broader truth about how we now approach the past: less concerned with learning from forefathers and more interested in feeling their pain. Today, we want empathy, not inspiration.
 
　　From the earliest days of the Renaissance, the writing of history meant recounting the exemplary lives of great men. In 1337, Petrarch began work on his rambling writing De Viris Illustribus C On Famous Men, highlighting the virtus (or virtue) of classical heroes. Petrarch celebrated their greatness in conquering fortune and rising to the top. This was the biographical tradition which Niccolo Machiavelli turned on its head. In The Prince, the championed cunning, ruthlessness, and boldness, rather than virtue, mercy and justice, as the skills of successful leaders.
 
　　Over time, the attributes of greatness shifted. The Romantics commemorated the leading painters and authors of their day, stressing the uniqueness of the artist's personal experience rather than public glory. By contrast, the Victorian author Samual Smiles wrote Self-Help as a catalogue of the worthy lives of engineers , industrialists and explores . "The valuable examples which they furnish of the power of self-help, if patient purpose, resolute working and steadfast integrity, issuing in the formulation of truly noble and many character, exhibit,"wrote Smiles."what it is in the power of each to accomplish for himself"His biographies of James Walt, Richard Arkwright and Josiah Wedgwood were held up as beacons to guide the working man through his difficult life.
 
　　This was all a bit bourgeois for Thomas Carlyle, who focused his biographies on the truly heroic lives of Martin Luther, Oliver Cromwell and Napoleon Bonaparte. These epochal figures represented lives hard to imitate, but to be acknowledged as possessing higher authority than mere mortals.
 
　　Communist Manifesto. For them, history did nothing, it possessed no immense wealth nor waged battles:“It is man, real, living man who does all that.” And history should be the story of the masses and their record of struggle. As such, it needed to appreciate the economic realities, the social contexts and power relations in which each epoch stood. For:“Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly found, given and transmitted from the past.”
 
　　This was the tradition which revolutionized our appreciation of the past. In place of Thomas Carlyle, Britain nurtured Christopher Hill, EP Thompson and Eric Hobsbawm. History from below stood alongside biographies of great men. Whole new realms of understanding ― from gender to race to cultural studies ― were opened up as scholars unpicked the multiplicity of lost societies. And it transformed public history too: downstairs became just as fascinating as upstairs.

The Internet affords anonymity to its users, a blessing to privacy and freedom of speech. But that very anonymity is also behind the explosion of cyber-crime that has  1  across the Web.
Can privacy be preserved  2   bringing safety and security to a world that seems increasingly  3   ?
Last month, Howard Schmidt, the nation’s cyber-czar, offered the federal government a  4  to make the Web a safer place-a “voluntary trusted identity” system that would be the high-tech  5  of a physical key, a fingerprint and a photo ID card, all rolled  6  one. The system might use a smart identity card, or a digital credential  7  to a specific computer .and would authenticate users at a range of online services.
The idea is to  8  a federation of private online identity systems. User could  9  which system to join, and only registered users whose identities have been authenticated could navigate those systems. The approach contrasts with one that would require an Internet driver’s license      10    by the government.
Google and Microsoft are among companies that already have these “single sign-on” systems that make it possible for users to   11  just once but use many different services.
  12 .the approach would create a “walled garden” n cyberspace, with safe “neighborhoods” and bright “streetlights” to establish a sense of a   13  community.
Mr. Schmidt described it as a “voluntary ecosystem” in which “individuals and organizations can complete online transactions with  14  ,trusting the identities of each other and the identities of the infrastructure  15  which the transaction runs”.
Still, the administration’s plan has  16  privacy rights activists. Some applaud the approach; others are concerned. It seems clear that such a scheme is an initiative push toward what would  17  be a compulsory Internet “drive’s license” mentality.
The plan has also been greeted with  18  by some computer security experts, who worry that the “voluntary ecosystem” envisioned by Mr. Schmidt would still leave much of the Internet  19  .They argue that all Internet users should be  20  to register and identify themselves, in the same way that drivers must be licensed to drive on public roads.

Ruth Simmons joined Goldman Sachs’s board as an outside director in January 2000: a year later she became president of Brown University. For the rest of the decade she apparently managed both roles without attracting much eroticism. But by the end of 2009 Ms. Simmons was under fire for having sat on Goldman’s compensation committee; how could she have let those enormous bonus payouts pass unremarked? By February the next year Ms. Simmons had left the board. The position was just taking up too much time, she said.
Outside directors are supposed to serve as helpful, yet less biased, advisers on a firm’s board. Having made their wealth and their reputations elsewhere, they presumably have enough independence to disagree with the chief executive’s proposals. If the sky, and the share price is falling, outside directors should be able to give advice based on having weathered their own crises. 
The researchers from Ohio University used a database hat covered more than 10,000 firms and more than 64,000 different directors between 1989 and 2004. Then they simply checked which directors stayed from one proxy statement to the next. The most likely reason for departing a board was age, so the researchers concentrated on those “surprise” disappearances by directors under the age of 70. They fount that after a surprise departure, the probability that the company will subsequently have to restate earnings increased by nearly 20%. The likelihood of being named in a federal class-action lawsuit also increases, and the stock is likely to perform worse. The effect tended to be larger for larger firms. Although a correlation between them leaving and subsequent bad performance at the firm is suggestive, it does not mean that such directors are always jumping off a sinking ship. Often they “trade up.” Leaving riskier, smaller firms for larger and more stable firms.
But the researchers believe that outside directors have an easier time of avoiding a blow to their reputations if they leave a firm before bad news breaks, even if a review of history shows they were on the board at the time any wrongdoing occurred. Firms who want to keep their outside directors through tough times may have to create incentives. Otherwise outside directors will follow the example of Ms. Simmons, once again very popular on campus.
21. According to Paragraph 1, Ms. Simmons was criticized for         . 
[A]gaining excessive profits
[B]failing to fulfill her duty
[C]refusing to make compromises
[D]leaving the board in tough times

Whatever happened to the death of newspaper? A year ago the end seemed near. The recession threatened to remove the advertising and readers that had not already fled to the internet. Newspapers like the San Francisco Chronicle were chronicling their own doom. America’s Federal Trade commission launched a round of talks about how to save newspapers. Should they become charitable corporations? Should the state subsidize them ? It will hold another meeting soon. But the discussions now seem out of date. 
In much of the world there is the sign of crisis. German and Brazilian papers have shrugged off the recession. Even American newspapers, which inhabit the most troubled come of the global industry, have not only survived but often returned to profit. Not the 20% profit margins that were routine a few years ago, but profit all the same.
It has not been much fun. Many papers stayed afloat by pushing journalists overboard. The American Society of News Editors reckons that 13,500 newsroom jobs have gone since 2007. Readers are paying more for slimmer products. Some papers even had the nerve to refuse delivery to distant suburbs. Yet these desperate measures have proved the right ones and, sadly for many journalists, they can be pushed further. 
Newspapers are becoming more balanced businesses, with a healthier mix of revenues from readers and advertisers. American papers have long been highly unusual in their reliance on ads. Fully 87% of their revenues came from advertising in 2008, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development (OECD). In Japan the proportion is 35%. Not surprisingly, Japanese newspapers are much more stable. 
The whirlwind that swept through newsrooms harmed everybody, but much of the damage has been concentrated in areas where newspaper are least distinctive. Car and film reviewers have gone. So have science and general business reporters. Foreign bureaus have been savagely cut off. Newspapers are less complete as a result. But completeness is no longer a virtue in the newspaper business.
26. By saying “Newspapers like … their own doom” (Lines 3-4, Para. 1), the author indicates that newspaper        .
[A]neglected the sign of crisis
[B]failed to get state subsidies
[C]were not charitable corporations
[D]were in a desperate situation
27. Some newspapers refused delivery to distant suburbs probably because       .
[A]readers threatened to pay less
[B]newspapers wanted to reduce costs
[C]journalists reported little about these areas
[D]subscribers complained about slimmer products
28. Compared with their American counterparts, Japanese newspapers are much more stable because they       .
[A]have more sources of revenue 
[B]have more balanced newsrooms
[C]are less dependent on advertising 
[D]are less affected by readership
29. What can be inferred from the last paragraph about the current newspaper business?
[A]Distinctiveness is an essential feature of newspapers.
[B]Completeness is to blame for the failure of newspaper.
[C]Foreign bureaus play a crucial role in the newspaper business.
[D]Readers have lost their interest in car and film reviews.
30. The most appropriate title for this text would be         .
[A]American Newspapers: Struggling for Survival
[B]American Newspapers: Gone with the Wind
[C]American Newspapers: A Thriving Business
[D]American Newspapers: A Hopeless Story 
Text 3
We tend to think of the decades immediately following World War II as a time of prosperity and growth, with soldiers returning home by the millions, going off to college on the G. I. Bill and lining up at the marriage bureaus. 
But when it came to their houses, it was a time of common sense and a belief that less could truly be more. During the Depression and the war, Americans had learned to live with less, and that restraint, in combination with the postwar confidence in the future, made small, efficient housing positively stylish.
Economic condition was only a stimulus for the trend toward efficient living. The phrase “less is more” was actually first popularized by a German, the architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who like other people associated with the Bauhaus, a school of design, emigrated to the United States before World War II
and took up posts at American architecture schools. These designers came to exert enormous influence on the course of American architecture, but none more so that Mies. 
Mies’s signature phrase means that less decoration, properly organized, has more impact that a lot. Elegance, he believed, did not derive from abundance. Like other modern architects, he employed metal, glass and laminated wood-materials that we take for granted today buy that in the 1940s symbolized the future. Mies’s sophisticated presentation masked the fact that the spaces he designed were small and efficient, rather than big and often empty. 
The apartments in the elegant towers Mies built on Chicago’s Lake Shore Drive, for example, were smaller-two-bedroom units under 1,000 square feet-than those in their older neighbors along the city’s Gold Coast. But they were popular because of their airy glass walls, the views they afforded and the elegance of the buildings’ details and proportions, the architectural equivalent of the abstract art so popular at the time. 
The trend toward “less” was not entirely foreign. In the 1930s Frank Lloyd Wright started building more modest and efficient houses-usually around 1,200 square feet-than the spreading two-story ones he had designed in the 1890s and the early 20th century.
The “Case Study Houses” commissioned from talented modern architects by California Arts & Architecture magazine between 1945 and 1962 were yet another homegrown influence on the “less is more” trend. Aesthetic effect came from the landscape, new materials and forthright detailing. In his Case Study House, Ralph everyday life - few American families acquired helicopters, though most eventually got clothes dryers - but his belief that self-sufficiency was both desirable and inevitable was widely shared. 
31. The postwar American housing style largely reflected the Americans’         .
[A]prosperity and growth
[B]efficiency and practicality 
[C]restraint and confidence
[D]pride and faithfulness
32. Which of the following can be inferred from Paragraph 3 about Bauhaus?
[A]It was founded by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.
[B]Its designing concept was affected by World War II.
[C]Most American architects used to be associated with it.
[D]It had a great influence upon American architecture.
33. Mies held that elegance of architectural design         .
[A]was related to large space
[B]was identified with emptiness
[C]was not reliant on abundant decoration
[D]was not associated with efficiency
34. What is true about the apartments Mies building Chicago’s Lake Shore Drive?
[A]They ignored details and proportions.
[B]They were built with materials popular at that time.
[C]They were more spacious than neighboring buildings. 
[D]They shared some characteristics of abstract art.
35. What can we learn about the design of the “Case Study House”?
[A]Mechanical devices were widely used.
[B]Natural scenes were taken into consideration 
[C]Details were sacrificed for the overall effect.
[D]Eco-friendly materials were employed.

Will the European Union make it? The question would have sounded strange not long ago. Now even the project’s greatest cheerleader’s talk of a continent facing a “Bermuda triangle” of debt, population decline and lower growth.
As well as those chronic problems, the EU faces an acute crisis in its economic core, the 16 countries that use the single currency. Markets have lost faith that the euro zone’s economies, weaker or stronger, will one day converge thanks to the discipline of sharing a single currency, which denies uncompetitive members the quick fix of devaluation.
Yet the debate about how to save Europe’s single currency from disintegration is stuck. It is stuck because the euro zone’s dominant powers, France and Germany, agree on the need for greater harmonization within the euro zone, but disagree about what to harmonies.
Germany thinks the euro must be saved by stricter rules on borrow spending and competitiveness, barked by quasi-automatic sanctions for governments that do not obey. These might include threats to freeze EU funds for poorer regions and EU mega-projects and even the suspension of a country’s voting rights in EU ministerial councils. It insists that economic co-ordination should involve all 27 members of the EU club, among whom there is a small majority for free-market liberalism and economic rigors; in the inner core alone, Germany fears, a small majority favour French interference.
A “southern” camp headed by French wants something different:”European economic government” within an inner core of euro-zone members. Translated, that means politicians intervening in monetary policy and a system of redistribution from richer to poorer members, via cheaper borrowing for governments through common Eurobonds or complete fiscal transfers. Finally, figures close to the France government have murmured, euro-zone members should agree to some fiscal and social harmonization: e.g., curbing competition in corporate-tax rates or labour costs.
It is too soon to write off the EU. It remains the world’s largest trading block. At its best, the European project is remarkably liberal: built around a single market of 27 rich and poor countries, its internal borders are far more open to goods, capital and labour than any comparable trading area. It is an ambitious attempt to blunt the sharpest edges of globalization, and make capitalism benign.
36. The EU is faced with so many problems that           .
[A] it has more or less lost faith in markets 
[B] even its supporters begin to feel concerned 
[C] some of its member countries plan to abandon euro
[D] it intends to deny the possibility of devaluation
37. The debate over the EU’s single currency is stuck because the dominant powers         .
[A] are competing for the leading position 
[B] are busy handling their own crises
[C] fail to reach an agreement on harmonization 
[D] disagree on the steps towards disintegration
38. To solve the euro problem, Germany proposed that       .
[A] EU funds for poor regions be increased
[B] stricter regulations be imposed
[C] only core members be involved in economic co-ordination 
[D] voting rights of the EU members be guaranteed
39. The French proposal of handling the crisis implies that __  __.
[A] poor countries are more likely to get funds
[B] strict monetary policy will be applied to poor countries
[C] loans will be readily available to rich countries
[D] rich countries will basically control Eurobonds
40. Regarding the future of the EU, the author seems to feel __  __.

Leading doctors today weigh in on the debate over the government's role in promoting public health by demanding that ministers impose "fat taxes" on unhealthy food and introduce cigarette-style warnings to children about the dangers of a poor diet. 
The demands follow comments last week by the health secretary, Andrew Lansley, who insisted the government could not force people to make healthy choices and promised to free businesses from public health regulations. 
But senior medical figures want to stop fast-food outlets opening near schools, restrict advertising of products high in fat, salt or sugar, and limit sponsorship of sports events by fast-food producers such as McDonald's. 
They argue that government action is necessary to curb Britain's addiction to unhealthy food and help halt spiraling rates of obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Professor Terence Stephenson, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said that the consumption of unhealthy food should be seen to be just as damaging as smoking or binge drinking. 
"Thirty years ago, it would have been inconceivable to have imagined a ban on smoking in the workplace or in pubs, and yet that is what we have now. Are we willing to be just as courageous in respect of obesity? I would suggest that we should be," said the leader of the UK's children's doctors. 
Lansley has alarmed health campaigners by suggesting he wants industry rather than government to take the lead. He said that manufacturers of crisps and confectionery could play a central role in the Change4Life campaign, the centrepiece of government efforts to boost healthy eating and fitness. He has also criticised the celebrity chef Jamie Oliver's high-profile attempt to improve school lunches in England as an example of how "lecturing" people was not the best way to change their behaviour. 
Stephenson suggested potential restrictions could include banning TV advertisements for foods high in fat, salt or sugar before the 9pm watershed and limiting them on billboards or in cinemas. "If we were really bold, we might even begin to think of high-calorie fast food in the same way as cigarettes C by setting stringent limits on advertising, product placement and sponsorship of sports events," he said. 
Such a move could affect firms such as McDonald's, which sponsors the youth coaching scheme run by the Football Association. Fast-food chains should also stop offering "inducements" such as toys, cute animals and mobile phone credit to lure young customers, Stephenson said. 
Professor Dinesh Bhugra, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: "If children are taught about the impact that food has on their growth, and that some things can harm, at least information is available up front." 
He also urged councils to impose "fast-food-free zones" around schools and hospitals C areas within which takeaways cannot open. 
A Department of Health spokesperson said: "We need to create a new vision for public health where all of society works together to get healthy and live longer. This includes creating a new 'responsibility deal' with business, built on social responsibility, not state regulation. Later this year, we will publish a white paper setting out exactly how we will achieve this." 
The food industry will be alarmed that such senior doctors back such radical moves, especially the call to use some of the tough tactics that have been deployed against smoking over the last decade.

	A “fat taxes” should be imposed on
fast-food producers such as
McDonald’s
	B the government should ban
fast-food outlets in the neighborhood
of schools
41.Andrew Lansley held that	C “lecturing” was an effective way
to improve school lunches in

42.Terence Stephenson agreed that	D cigarette-style warnings should be
introduced to children about the
dangers of a poor diet
43.Jamie Oliver seemed to believe

could contribute significantly to the
Change4Life campaign
44.Dinesh Bhugra suggested that	F parents should set good examples

Who would have thought that, globally, the IT industry produces about the same volume of greenhouse gases as the world’s airlines do-roughly 2 percent of all CO2 emissions?
Many everyday tasks take a surprising toll on the environment. A Google search can leak between 0.2 and 7.0 grams of CO2, depending on how many attempts are needed to get the “right” answer. To deliver results to its users quickly, then, Google has to maintain vast data centres round the world, packed with powerful computers. While producing large quantities of CO2, these computers emit a great deal of heat, so the centres need to be well air-conditioned, which uses even more energy.
However, Google and other big tech providers monitor their efficiency closely and make improvements. Monitoring is the first step on the road to reduction, but there is much more to be done, and not just by big companies.

　　The longest bull run in a century of art-market history ended on a dramatic note with a sale of 56 works by Damien Hirst, “Beautiful Inside My Head Forever”，at Sotheby’s in London on September 15th 2008. All but two pieces sold, fetching more than ￡70m, a record for a sale by a single artist. It was a last victory. As the auctioneer called out bids, in New York one of the oldest banks on Wall Street, Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy. 
　The world art market had already been losing momentum for a while after rising bewilderingly since 2003. At its peak in 2007 it was worth some $65 billion, reckons Clare Mc Andrew, founder of Arts Economics, a research firm―double the figure five years earlier. Since then it may have come down to $50 billion. But the market generates interest far beyond its size because it brings together great wealth, enormous egos, greed, passion and controversy in a way matched by few other industries. 
　　In the weeks and months that followed Mr. Hirst’s sale, spending of any sort became deeply unfashionable, especially in New York, where the bail-out of the banks coincided with the loss of thousands of jobs and the financial demise of many art-buying investors. In the art world that meant collectors stayed away from galleries and salerooms. Sales of contemporary art fell by two-thirds, and in the most overheated sector―for Chinese contemporary art―they were down by nearly 90% in the year to November 2008. Within weeks the world’s two biggest auction houses, Sotheby’s and Christie’s, had to pay out nearly $200m in guarantees to clients who had placed works for sale with them. 
　　The current downturn in the art market is the worst since the Japanese stopped buying Impressionists at the end of 1989, a move that started the most serious contraction in the market since the Second World War. This time experts reckon that prices are about 40% down on their peak on average, though some have been far more fluctuant. But Edward Dolman, Christie’s chief executive, says: “I’m pretty confident we’re at the bottom.”
　　What makes this slump different from the last, he says, is that there are still buyers in the market, whereas in the early 1990s, when interest rates were high, there was no demand even though many collectors wanted to sell. Christie’s revenues in the first half of 2009 were still higher than in the first half of 2006. Almost everyone who was interviewed for this special report said that the biggest problem at the moment is not a lack of demand but a lack of good work to sell. The three Ds―death, debt and divorce―still deliver works of art to the market. But anyone who does not have to sell is keeping away, waiting for confidence to return.
21. In the first paragraph, Damien Hirst's sale was referred to as “a last victory” because ____.
　　A. the art market had witnessed a succession of victories
　　B. the auctioneer finally got the two pieces at the highest bids
　　C. Beautiful Inside My Head Forever won over all masterpieces
　　D. it was successfully made just before the world financial crisis
22.By saying “spending of any sort became deeply unfashionable”(Line 1-2,Para.3)，the author suggests that_____. 
　　A. collectors were no longer actively involved in art-market auctions
　　B .people stopped every kind of spending and stayed away from galleries
　　C. art collection as a fashion had lost its appeal to a great extent
D .works of art in general had gone out of fashion so they were not worth buying
23. Which of the following statements is NOT true?
　　A .Sales of contemporary art fell dramatically from 2007 to 2008.
　　B. The art market surpassed many other industries in momentum.
　　C. The market generally went downward in various ways.
　　D. Some art dealers were awaiting better chances to come.
24. The three Ds mentioned in the last paragraph are ____
A. auction houses ' favorites　B. contemporary trends　
C. factors promoting artwork circulation　D. styles representing impressionists
25. The most appropriate title for this text could be ___
A. Fluctuation of Art Prices　
B. Up-to-date Art Auctions

TEXT2
　　I was addressing a small gathering in a suburban Virginia living room―a women's group that had invited men to join them. Throughout the evening one man had been particularly talkative, frequently offering ideas and anecdotes, while his wife sat silently beside him on the couch. Toward the end of the evening I commented that women frequently complain that their husbands don't talk to them. This man quickly nodded in agreement. He gestured toward his wife and said, "She's the talker in our family." The room burst into laughter; the man looked puzzled and hurt. "It's true," he explained. "When I come home from work, I have nothing to say. If she didn't keep the conversation going, we'd spend the whole evening in silence."
　　This episode crystallizes the irony that although American men tend to talk more than women in public situations, they often talk less at home. And this pattern is wreaking havoc with marriage. 
　　The pattern was observed by political scientist Andrew Hacker in the late 1970s. Sociologist Catherine Kohler Riessman reports in her new book "Divorce Talk" that most of the women she interviewed―but only a few of the men―gave lack of communication as the reason for their divorces. Given the current divorce rate of nearly 50 percent，that amounts to millions of cases in the United States every year ―a virtual epidemic of failed conversation.
　　In my own research complaints from women about their husbands most often focused not on tangible inequities such as having given up the chance for a career to accompany a husband to his or doing far more than their share of daily life-support work like cleaning, cooking, social arrangements and errands. Instead they focused on communication: "He doesn't listen to me." "He doesn't talk to me." I found as Hacker observed years before that most wives want their husbands to be first and foremost conversational partners but few husbands share this expectation of their wives. 
　　In short the image that best represents the current crisis is the stereotypical cartoon scene of a man sitting at the breakfast table with a newspaper held up in front of his face, while a woman glares at the back of it, wanting to talk. 
26. What is most wives' main expectation of their husbands?
　　A. Talking to them.  B. Trusting them.　C. Supporting their careers.　D. Sharing housework.
27. Judging from the context, the phrase “wreaking havoc”(Line 3,Para.2)most probably means ___ .
　　A. generating motivation.  B. exerting influence　C. causing damage　D. creating pressure
28. All of the following are true EXCEPT_______
　 A. men tend to talk more in public than women  
B. nearly 50 percent of recent divorces are caused by failed conversation
　 C. women attach much importance to communication between couples 
D. a female tends to be more talkative at home than her spouse
29. Which of the following can best summarize the main idea of this text?
A. The moral decaying deserves more research by sociologists. 
B. Marriage break-up stems from sex inequalities.
C. Husband and wife have different expectations from their marriage. 
D. Conversational patterns between man and wife are different. 
30. In the following part immediately after this text, the author will most probably focus on ______
A. a vivid account of the new book Divorce Talk 
B. a detailed description of the stereotypical cartoon
C. other possible reasons for a high divorce rate in the U.S. 
D. a brief introduction to the political scientist Andrew Hacker

　　Over the past decade, many companies had perfected the art of creating automatic behaviors ― habits ― among consumers. These habits have helped companies earn billions of dollars when customers eat snacks, apply lotions and wipe counters almost without thinking, often in response to a carefully designed set of daily cues.
　　“There are fundamental public health problems, like dirty hands instead of a soap habit, that remain killers only because we can’t figure out how to change people’s habits,” Dr. Curtis said. “We wanted to learn from private industry how to create new behaviors that happen automatically.”
　　The companies that Dr. Curtis turned to ― Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and Unilever ― had invested hundreds of millions of dollars finding the subtle cues in consumers’ lives that corporations could use to introduce new routines.
If you look hard enough, you’ll find that many of the products we use every day ― chewing gums, skin moisturizers, disinfecting wipes, air fresheners, water purifiers, health snacks, antiperspirants, colognes, teeth whiteners, fabric softeners, vitamins― are results of manufactured habits. A century ago, few people regularly brushed their teeth multiple times a day. Today, because of canny advertising and public health campaigns, many Americans habitually give their pearly whites a cavity-preventing scrub twice a day, often with Colgate, Crest or one of the other brands.
	A few decades ago, many people didn’t drink water outside of a meal. Then beverage companies started bottling the production of far-off springs, and now office workers unthinkingly sip bottled water all day long. Chewing gum, once bought primarily by adolescent boys, is now featured in commercials as a breath freshener and teeth cleanser for use after a meal. Skin moisturizers are advertised as part of morning beauty rituals, slipped in between hair brushing and putting on makeup.
　　“Our products succeed when they become part of daily or weekly patterns,” said Carol Berning, a consumer psychologist who recently retired from Procter & Gamble, the company that sold $76 billion of Tide, Crest and other products last year. “Creating positive habits is a huge part of improving our consumers’ lives, and it’s essential to making new products commercially viable.”
　　Through experiments and observation, social scientists like Dr. Berning have learned that there is power in tying certain behaviors to habitual cues through relentless advertising. As this new science of habit has emerged, controversies have erupted when the tactics have been used to sell questionable beauty creams or unhealthy foods.
31. According to Dr. Curtis, habits like hand washing with soap________.
A. should be further cultivated
B. should be changed gradually 
C. are deeply rooted in history 
D. are basically private concerns
32. Bottled water, chewing gun and skin moisturizers are mentioned in Paragraph 5 so as to____
A. reveal their impact on people’s habits        
B. show the urgent need of daily necessities
C. indicate their effect on people’s buying power　
D. manifest the significant role of good habits
33. Which of the following does NOT belong to products that help create people’s habits?
A. Tide　
B. Crest　
C. Colgate　
D. Unilever
34. From the text we know that some of consumer’s habits are developed due to _____
A. perfected art of products 
B. automatic behavior creation　
C. commercial promotions　
D. scientific experiments
35. The author’s attitude toward the influence of advertisement on people’s habits is____
A. indifferent　
B. negative　
C. positive　
D. biased

　　Many Americans regard the jury system as a concrete expression of crucial democratic values, including the principles that all citizens who meet minimal qualifications of age and literacy are equally competent to serve on juries; that jurors should be selected randomly from a representative cross section of the community; that no citizen should be denied the right to serve on a jury on account of race, religion, sex, or national origin; that defendants are entitled to trial by their peers; and that verdicts should represent the conscience of the community and not just the letter of the law. The jury is also said to be the best surviving example of direct rather than representative democracy. In a direct democracy, citizens take turns governing themselves, rather than electing representatives to govern for them.
　　But as recently as in 1986, jury selection procedures conflicted with these democratic ideals. In some states, for example, jury duty was limited to persons of supposedly superior intelligence, education, and moral character. Although the Supreme Court of the United States had prohibited intentional racial discrimination in jury selection as early as the 1880 case of Strauder v. West Virginia, the practice of selecting so-called elite or blue-ribbon juries provided a convenient way around this and other antidiscrimination laws.
　　The system also failed to regularly include women on juries until the mid-20th century. Although women first served on state juries in Utah in 1898, it was not until the 1940s that a majority of states made women eligible for jury duty. Even then several states automatically exempted women from jury duty unless they personally asked to have their names included on the jury list. This practice was justified by the claim that women were needed at home, and it kept juries unrepresentative of women through the 1960s.
　　In 1968, the Congress of the United States passed the Jury Selection and Service Act, ushering in a new era of democratic reforms for the jury. This law abolished special educational requirements for federal jurors and required them to be selected at random from a cross section of the entire community. In the landmark 1975 decision Taylor vs. Louisiana, the Supreme Court extended the requirement that juries be representative of all parts of the community to the state level. The Taylor decision also declared sex discrimination in jury selection to be unconstitutional and ordered states to use the same procedures for selecting male and female jurors.
36. From the principles of the US jury system, we learn that ______
A. both liberate and illiterate people can serve on juries
B. defendants are immune from trial by their peers
C. no age limit should be imposed for jury service　
D. judgment should consider the opinion of the public
37. The practice of selecting so-called elite jurors prior to 1968 showed_____
A. the inadequacy of antidiscrimination laws　
B. the prevalent discrimination against certain races
C. the conflicting ideals in jury selection procedures　
D. the arrogance common among the Supreme Court justices  
38. Even in the 1960s, women were seldom on the jury list in some states because_____
A. they were automatically banned by state laws
B. they fell far short of the required qualifications
C. they were supposed to perform domestic duties　
D. they tended to evade public engagement
39. After the Jury Selection and Service Act was passed.___
　 A. sex discrimination in jury selection was unconstitutional and had to be abolished
　 B. educational requirements became less rigid in the selection of federal jurors
　 C. jurors at the state level ought to be representative of the entire community
　 D. states ought to conform to the federal court in reforming the jury system
40. In discussing the US jury system, the text centers on_______
A. its nature and problems
B. its characteristics and tradition
C. its problems and their solutions
D. its tradition and development
Part B
Both Boeing and Airbus have trumpeted the efficiency of their newest aircraft, the 787 and A350 respectively. Their clever designs and lightweight composites certainly make a difference. But a group of researchers at Stanford University, led by Ilan Kroo, has suggested that airlines could take a more naturalistic approach to cutting jet-fuel use, and it would not require them to buy new aircraft.
　　The answer, says Dr Kroo, lies with birds. Since 1914, and a seminal paper by a German researcher called Carl Wiesel Berger, scientists have known that birds flying in formation―a V-shape, echelon or otherwise―expend less energy. The air flowing over a bird’s wings curls upwards behind the wingtips, a phenomenon known as upwash. Other birds flying in the upwash experience reduced drag, and spend less energy propelling themselves. Peter Lissaman, an aeronautics expert who was formerly at Caltech and the University of Southern California, has suggested that a formation of 25 birds might enjoy a range increase of 71%。
　　When applied to aircraft, the principles are not substantially different. Dr Kroo and his team modeled what would happen if three passenger jets departing from Los Angeles, San Francisco and Las Vegas were to rendezvous over Utah, assume an inverted V-formation, occasionally swap places so all could have a turn in the most favorable positions, and proceed to London. They found that the aircraft consumed as much as 15% less fuel (coupled with a reduction in carbon-dioxide output). Nitrogen-oxide emissions during the cruising portions of the flight fell by around a quarter。
　　There are, of course, kinks to be worked out. One consideration is safety, or at least the perception of it. Would passengers feel comfortable traveling in convoy? Dr Kroo points out that the aircraft could be separated by several nautical miles, and would not be in the intimate groupings favored by display teams like the Red Arrows. A passenger peering out of the window might not even see the other planes. Whether the separation distances involved would satisfy air-traffic-control regulations is another matter, although a working group at the International Civil Aviation Organization has included the possibility of formation flying in a blueprint for new operational guidelines。
　　It remains to be seen how weather conditions affect the air flows that make formation flight more efficient. In zones of increased turbulence, the planes’ wakes will decay more quickly and the effect will diminish. Dr Kroo says this is one of the areas his team will investigate further. It might also be hard for airlines to co-ordinate the departure times and destinations of passenger aircraft in a way that would allow them to gain from formation flight. Cargo aircraft, in contrast, might be easier to reschedule, as might routine military flights。
　　As it happens, America’s armed forces are on the case already. Earlier this year the country’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency announced plans to pay Boeing to investigate formation flight, though the program has yet to begin. There are reports that some military aircraft flew in formation when they were low on fuel during the Second World War, but Dr Lissaman says they are apocryphal. “My father was an RAF pilot and my cousin the skipper of a Lancaster lost over Berlin,” he adds. So he should know。
　　41. Findings of the Stanford University researchers will promote the sales of new Boeing and Airbus aircraft。
　　42. The upwash experience may save propelling energy as well as reducing resistance。
　　43. Formation flight is more comfortable because passengers can not see the other planes。
　　44. The role that weather plays in formation flight has not yet been clearly defined。
　　45. It has been documented that during World War II, America’s armed forces once tried formation flight to save fuel.

　　“Sustainability” has become a popular word these days, but to Ted Ning, the concept will always have personal meaning. Having endured a painful period of unsustainability in his own life made it clear to him that sustainability-oriented values must be expressed though everyday action and choice。
　　Ning recalls spending a confusing year in the late 1990s selling insurance. He’d been though the dot-com boom and burst and, desperate for a job, signed on with a Boulder agency。
　　It didn’t go well. “It was a really had move because that’s not my passion,” says Ning, whose dilemma about the job translated, predictably, into a lack of sales. “I was miserable, I had so much anxiety that I would wake up in the middle of the night and stare at the ceiling. I had no money and needed the job. Everyone said, ‘Just wait, you’ll turn the corner, give it some time.’”

　　In1999, the price of oil hovered around $16 a barrel. By 2008, it had   21 the $100 a barrel mark. The reasons for the surge 22    from the dramatic growth of the economies of china and India to widespread   23   in oil-producing regions, including Iraq and Nigeria’s  delta region. Triple-digit oil prices have   24   the  economic  and political map of the world,   25  some old notions of power.

　　Countries like Russia, Venezuela and Iran are well supplied with rising  oil  33, a change reflected in newly aggressive foreign policies. But some unexpected countries are reaping benefits,    34 costs,  from  higher  prices. Consider Germany.  35  it  imports virtually all its oil, it has prospered from extensive trade with a booming Russia and the Middle East. German exports to Russia   36   128 percent from 2001 to 2006.

　　Part III Reading Comprehension (40%)

　　Direction: There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A, B, C, and D. You should decide on the best choice. Then blacken the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a pencil.

　　PASSAGE1.

　　Henric Ibsen ,author of the play"A Doll’s House", in which a pretty, helpless housewife abandons

　　Her husband and children to seek a more serious life, would surely have approved.. From January Ist ,

　　2008, all public companies in Norway are obliged to ensure that at least 40% of their board directors are 

　　women. Most firms have obeyed the law, which was passed in 2003.But about 75 out of the 480 or so

　　companies it affects are still too male for the government’s liking. They will shortly receive a letter

　　informing them that they have until the end of February to act , or face the legal consequences---which

　　could include being dissolved.

　　Before the law was proposed, about 7% of board members in Norway were female , according to the Centre for Corporate Diversity .The number has since jumped to 36%. That is far higher than the average of 9% for big companies across Europe or America’s 15% for the Fortune 500.Norway’s stock exchange and its main business lobby oppose the law, as do many businessmen." I am against quotas for women or men as a matter of principle," says Sverre Munck , head of international operations at a media firm. "Board members of public companies should be chosen solely on the basis of merit and experience,"be says. Several firms have even given up their public status in order to escape the new law.

　　Companies have had to recruit about 1,000 women in four years. Many complain that it has been

　　Difficult to find experienced candidates. Because of this, some of the best women have collected as many as 25-35 directorships each, and are known in Norwegian business circles as the "golden skirts". One reason for the scarcity is that there are fairly few women in management in Norwegian companies---they occupy around 15% of senior positions. It has been particularly hard for firms in the oil, technology and financial industries to find women with a enough experience.

　　Some people worry that their relative lack of experience may keep women quiet on boards, and that

　　In turn could mean that boards might become less able to hold managers to account. Recent history in Norway, however, suggests that the right women can make strong directors. "Women feel more compelled than men to do their homework," says Ms Reksten Skaugen , who was voted Norway’s chairman of the year for 2007, "and we can afford to ask the hard questions, because women are not always expected to know the answers."

　　41. The author mentions Ibsen’s play in the first paragraph in order to           .
　　A. depict women’s dilemma at work
　　B. explain the newly passed law 
　　C. support Norwegian government
　　D. introduce the topic under discussion

　　42. A public company that fails to obey the new law could be forced to           .
　　A. pay a heavy fine
　　B. close down its business
　　C. change to a private business
　　D. sign a document promising to act

　　43. To which of the following is Sverre Munck most likely to agree?

　　A. A set ratio of women in a board is unreasonable.
　　B. A reasonable quota for women at work needs to be set.
　　C. A common principle should be followed by all companies.
　　D. An inexperienced businessman is not subject to the new law.
　　
44.The author attributes the phenomenon of "golden skirts" to            .
　　A. the small number of qualified females in management
　　B. the over-recruitment of female managers in public companies
　　C. the advantage women enjoy when competing for senior positions
　　D. the discrimination toward women in Norwegian business circles

　　45. The main idea of the passage might be         .

　　A. female power and liberation in Norway
　　B. the significance of Henric Ibsen’s play
　　C. women’s status in Norwegian firms
　　D. the constitution of board members in Norway

　　PASSAGE2. 

　　While there’s never a good age to get cancer, people in their 20s and 30s can feel particularly isolated. The average age of a cancer patient at diagnosis is 67. Children with cancer often are treated at pediatric (小儿科的) cancer centers, but young adults have a tough time finding peers, often sitting side-by-side during treatments with people who could be their grandparents.

　　In her new book Crazy Sexy Cancer Tips, writer Kris Carr looks at cancer from the perspective of a young adult who confronts death just as she’s discovering life. Ms. Carr was 31 when she was diagnosed with a rare from of cancer that had generated tumors on her liver and lungs.

　　Ms. Carr reacted with the normal feelings of shock and sadness. She called her parents and stocked up on organic food, determined to become a "full-time healing addict." Then she picked up the phone and called everyone in her address book, asking if they knew other young women with cancer. The result was her own personal "cancer posse": a rock concert tour manager, a model, a fashion magazine editor, a cartoonist and a MTV celebrity, to name a few. This club of  "cancer babes" offered support, advice and fashion tips, among other things.

　　Ms. Carr put her cancer experience in a recent Learning Channel documentary, and she has written a practical guide about how she coped. Cancer isn’t funny, but Ms. Carr often is. She swears, she makes up names for the people who treat her ( Dr. Fabulous and Dr. Guru ), and she even makes second sound fun ("cancer road trips," she calls them).

　　She leaves the medical advice to doctors, instead offering insightful and practical tips that reflect the world view of a young adult. "I refused to let cancer ruin my party," she writes. " There 

　　are just too many cool things to do and plan and live for."

　　Ms. Carr still has cancer, but it has stopped progressing. Her cancer tips include using time-saving mass e-mails to keep friends informed, sewing or buying fashionable hospital gowns so you’re not stuck with regulation blue or gray and playing Gloria Gaynor’s "I Will Survive" so loud you neighbors call the police. Ms. Carr also advises an eyebrow wax and a new outfit before you tell the important people in your illness. " people you tell are going to cautious and not so cautiously try to see the cancer, so dazzle them instead with your miracle," she writes.

　　While her advice may sound superficial, it gets to the heart of what every cancer patient wants: the chance to live life just as she always did, and maybe better.

　　46. Which of the following groups is more vulnerable to cancer?
　　A. Children.
　　B. People in their 20s and 30s.
　　C. Young adults.
　　D. Elderly people.

　　47. All of the following statements are true EXCEPT _______.
　　A. Kris Carr is a female writer
　　B. Kris Carr is more than 31-year-old.
　　C. Kris Carr works in a cancer center.
　　D. Kris Carr is very optimistic.

　　48. The phrase "cancer posse" (Line 4, para.3 ) probably refers to ________
　　A. a cancer research organization
　　B. a group of people who suffer from cancer
　　C. people who have recovered from cancer
　　D. people who cope with cancer

　　49. Kris Carr make up names for the people who treat her because ________
　　A. she is depressed and likes swearing
　　B. she is funny and likes playing jokes on doctor
　　C. she wants to leave the medical advice to doctor
　　D. she tries to leave a good impression on doctor

　　50. From Kris Carr’s cancer tips we may infer that ________
　　A. she learned to use e-mails after she got cancer
　　B. she wears fashionable dress even after suffering from cancer
　　C. hospital gowns for cancer patients are usually not in bright colors
　　D. the neighbors are very friendly with cancer patients

　　PASSAGE3。

　　Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage:

　　Should a leader strive to be loved or feared?This question,famously posed by Machiavelli,lies at the heart of Joseph Nye’s new book.Mr.Nye,a former dean of the Kennedy School of Govemment at Harvard and one-time chairman of America’s National Intelligence Council,is best known for promoting the idea of "soft power",based on persuasion and influence,as a counterpoint to "hard power",based on coercion(强迫) and force. 

　　Having analyzed the use of soft and hard power in politics and diplomacy in his previous books,Mr.Nye has now turned his attention to the relationship between power and leadership,in both the political and business spheres.Machiavelli,he notes,concluded that "one ought to be both feared and loved,but as it is difficult for the two to go together,it is much safer to be feared than loved."In short,hard power is preferable to soft power.But modem leadership theorists have come to the opposite conclusion.

　　The context of leadership is changing,the observe,and the historical emphasis on hard power is becoming outdated.In modem companies and democracies,power is increasingly diffused and traditional hierarchies(等级制) are being undermined,making soft power ever more important.But that does not mean coercion should now take a back seat to persuasion.Mr.Nye argues.Instead,he advocates a synthesis of these two views.The conclusion of The Powers to Lead ,his survey of the theory of leadership,is that a combination of hard and soft power,which he calls”smart power”,is the best approach.

　　The dominant theoretical model of leadership at the moment is ,apparently,the “transformational leadership pattern”.Anone allergic(反感) to management term will already be running for the exit,but Mr,Nye has performed a valuable service in rounding up and summarizing the various academic studies and theories of leadcriship into a single,slim volume.He examines different approaches to leadership,the morality of leadership and how the wider context can determine the effcctiveness of a particular leader.There are plcnty of anccdotes and examples,both historical and contemporary,political and corporate.

　　Alsa,leadership is a slippery subject,and as he depicts various theories,even Mr.Nye never quite nails the jelly to the wall.He is at his most interesting when discussing the moral aspects of leadershipin particular,the question of whether it is sometimes necessary for good leaders  to lie -and he provides a helpful 12-point summary of his conclusions.A recuming theme is that as circumstances change,different sorts of leadcrs are required;a leader who thrives in one environment may struggle in another,and vice versa.Ultimately that is just a fancy way of saying that leadcrship offers no casy answers.

　　51.From the first two paragraphs we may learn than Mr.Machiavelli’s idea of hard power is ______.
　　A.well accepted by Joseph Nye 
　　B.very influential till nowadays
　　C.based on sound theories
　　D.contrary to that of modem leadership theorists

　　52.Which of the following makes soft power more important today according to Mr.Nye?
　　A.Coercion is widespread.
　　B.Morality is devalued.
　　C.Power is no longer concentrated.
　　D.Traditional hierarchies are strengthened

　　53.In his book the Powers to lead,Mr.Nye has exmined all the following aspects of leadership EXCEPT_____.

　　A.authority
　　B.context
　　C.approaches
　　D.morality

　　54.Mr.Nye’s book is particularly valuable in that it _____.
　　A.makes little use of management terms
　　B.summarizes various studies concisely
　　C.serves as an exit for leadership researchers
　　D.sets a model for contemporary corporate leaders

　　55.According to the author,the most interesting part of Mr.Nye’s book lies in his _____.
　　A.view of changeable leadership
　　B.definition of good leadership
　　C.summary of leadership history
　　D.discussion of moral leadership

　　PASSAGE4

　　Questions 56to 60are based on the following passage:

　　Americans don’t like to lose wars. Of course, a lot depends on how you define just what a war is. There are shooting wars-the kind that test patriotism and courage-and those are the kind at which the U.S excels. But other struggles test those qualities too. What else was the Great Depression or the space race or the construction of the railroads? If American indulge in a bit of flag―when the job is done, they earned it. 

　　Now there is a similar challenge. Global warming. The steady deterioration(恶化)of the very climate of this very planet is becoming a war of the first order, and by any measure, the U.S. produces nearly a quarter of the world’s greenhouse gases each year and has stubbornly made it clear that it doesn’t intend to do a whole lot about it. Although 174 nations approved the admittedly flawed Kyoto accords to reduce carbon levels, the U.S. walked away from them. There are vague promises of manufacturing fuel from herbs or powering cars with hydrogen. But for a country that tightly cites patriotism as one of its core values, the U.S. is taking a pass on what might be the most patriotic struggle of all. It’s hard to imagine a bigger fight than one for the survival of a country’s coasts and farms, the health of its people and stability of its economy.

　　The rub is, if the vast majority of people increasingly agree that climate change is a global emergency, there’s far less agreement on how to fix it. Industry offers its pans, which too often would fix little. Environmentalists offer theirs, which too often amount to native wish lists that could weaken American’s growth. But let’s assume that those interested parties and others will always bent the table and will always demand that their voices be heard and that their needs be addressed. What would an aggressive, ambitious, effective plan look like-one that would leave the U.S. both environmentally safe and economically sound?

　　Halting climate change will be far harder. One of the more conservative plans for addressing the problem calls for a reduction of 25 billion tons of carbon emissions over the next 52 year. And yet by devising a consistent strategy that mixes and blends pragmatism(实用主义)with ambition, the U.S. can, without major damage to the economy, help halt the worst effects of climate change and ensure the survival of its way of life for future generations. Money will do some of the work, but what’s needed most is will. "I’m not saying the challenge isn’t almost overwhelming," says Fred Krupp. "But this is America, and America has risen to these challenges before."

　　56. What does the passage mainly discuss?
　　A. Human wars.
　　B. Economic crisis.
　　C. America’s environmental policies.
　　D. Global environment in general.

　　57. From the last sentence of paragraph 2 we may learn that the survival of a country’s coasts and farms, the health of its people and the stability of its economy is__________.

　　A. of utmost importance
　　B. a fight no one can win
　　C. beyond people’s imagination
　　D. a less significant issue

　　58. Judging from the context, the word "rub"(Line 1, Para.3)probably means_______.
　　A. friction
　　B. contradiction
　　C. conflict
　　D. problem

　　59. What is the author’s attitude toward America’s policies on global warming?
　　A. Critical
　　B. Indifferent 
　　C. Supportive
　　D. Compromising

　　60. The paragraphs immediately following this passage would most probably deal with___________.
　　A. the new book written by Fred Krupp
　　B. how America can fight against global warming
　　C. the harmful effects of global warming
　　D. how America can tide over economic crisis

　　翻译：

　　With the nation’s financial system teetering on a cliff. The compensation arrangements for executives of the big banks and other financial firms are coming under close examination again.

　　Bankers’ excessive risk- taking is a significant cause of this financial crisis and has continued, to others in the past, in this case, it was fueled by low interest rates and kept going by a false sense of security created by a debt-fueled bubble in the economy.

　　Mortgage lenders gladly lent enormous sums to those who could not afford to pay them back dividing the laws and selling them off to the next financial institution along the chain, advantage of the same high-tech securitization to load on more risky mortgage-based assets.

　　Financial regulation will have to catch up with the most irresponsible practices that led banks down in this road, in hopes averting the next crisis, which is likely to involve different financial techniques and different sorts of assets. But it is worth examining the root problem of compensation schemes that are tied to short-term profits and revenue’s, and thus encourage bankers to take irresponsible risks.

　　Part V Writing (20%)

　　Direction: In this section, you are asked to write an essay based on the following information. Make comments and express your own opinion. You should write at least 150 words on Answer Sheet 2.

　　At present, there is no doubt that short message plays an increasingly important role in our lives . We are all aware that, like everything else, short message have both favorable and unfavorable aspects.

　　Generally speaking, the advantages can be listed as follows. First of all, in festivals, we can send short messages to wish good luck to other people we know. It brings us a lot of convenience. In addition, short message connects its users with the outside world. For example, some people subscribe weather forecast or news short messages, with them, people’s life will be greatly enriched. 

　　But it is pity that every coin has two sides. The disadvantages of short message can’t be ignored. We spend too much time on spelling our words and sending short messages that we can’t focus on our studies. Also, you will always be annoyed by strangers’ short messages one after another.

　　As is known to all, short message is neither good nor bad itself. In my opinion, we can use it. But we shouldn’t spend too much time on it and don’t let it disturb us from our lives.

　　Section Ⅲ  Reading Comprehension
　　Directions: There are four passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A, B,C, and D. You should decide on the best choice and blacken the corresponding letter on ANSWER SHEET 1 . (40 points)

　　Questions 41 to 45 are based on the following passage:

　　Last weekend Kyle MacDonald in Montreal threw a party to celebrate the fact that he got his new home in exchange for a red paper clip. Starting a year ago, MacDonald bartered the clip for increasingly valuable stuff, including a camp stove and free rent in a Phoenix flat. Having announced his aim (the house) in advance, MacDonald likely got a boost from techies eager to see the Internet pass this daring test of its networking power. “My whole motto (座右铭) was ‘Start small, think big, and have fun’, ” says MacDonald, 26, “I really kept my effort on the creative side rather than the business side. ”

　　Yet as odd as the MacDonald exchange was, barter is now big business on the Net. This year more than 400,000 companies worldwide will exchange some $10 billion worth of goods and services on a growing number of barter sites. These Web sites allow companies to trade products for a virtual currency, which they can use to buy goods from other members. In Iceland, garment-maker Kapusalan sells a third of its output on the booming Vidskiptanetid exchange, earning virtual money that it uses to buy machinery and pay part of employee salaries. The Troc-services exchange in France offers more than 4,600 services, from math lessons to ironing.

　　This is not a primitive barter system. By creating currencies, the Internet removes a major barrier―what Bob Meyer, publisher of BarterNews, calls “the double coincidence of wants.” That is, two parties once not only had to find each other, but also an exchange of goods that both desired. Now, they can price the deal in virtual currency.

　　Barter also helps firms make use of idle capacity. For example, advertising is “hugely bartered” because many media, particularly on the Web can supply new ad space at little cost. Moreover, Internet ads don’t register in industry-growth statistics, because many exchanges are arranged outside the formal exchanges. 

　　Like eBay, most barter sites allow members to “grade” trading partners for honesty quality and so on.. Barter exchanges can allow firms in countries with hyperinflation or nontradable currencies to enter global trades. Next year, a nonprofit exchange called Quick Lift Two (QL2) plans to open in Nairobi, offering barter deals to 38,000 Kenyan farmers in remote areas. Two small planes will deliver the goods. QL2 director Gacii Waciuma says the farmers are excited to be “liberated from corrupt middlemen.” For them, barter evokes a bright future, not a precapitalist past.

　　41. The word “techies” (Line 4, Para 1) probably refers to those who are ＿＿＿.
　　A. afraid of technology                 B. skilled in technology
　　C. ignorant of technology               D. incompetent in technology
　　42. Many people may have deliberately helped Kyle because they ＿＿＿.
　　A. were impressed by his creativity       B. were eager to identify with his motto
　　C. liked his goal announced in advance    D. hoped to prove the power of the Internet
　　43. The Internet barter system relies heavily on ＿＿＿.
　　A. the size of barter sties                B. the use of virtual currency
　　C. the quality of goods or services        D. the location of trading companies]
　　44. It is implies that Internet advertisements can help ＿＿＿.
　　A. companies make more profit           B. companies do formal exchanges
　　C. media register in statistics             D. media grade barter sites
　　45. Which of the follow is true of QL2 according to the author?
　　A. It is criticized for doing business in a primitive way.
　　B. It aims to deal with hyperinflation in some countries.
　　C. It helps get rid of middlemen in trade and exchange.
　　D. It is intended to evaluate the performance of trading partners.

　　Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage: 

　　The lives of very few Newark residents are untouched by violence: New Jersey’s biggest city has seen it all. Yet the murder of three young people, who were forced to kneel before being shot in the back of the head in a school playground on August 4th, has shaken the city. A fourth, who survived, was stabbed and shot in the face. The four victims were by all accounts good kids, all enrolled in college, all with a future. But the cruel murder, it seems, has at last forced Newarkers to say they have had enough.

　　Grassroots organizations, like Stop Shooting, have been flooded with offers of help and support since the killings. Yusef Ismail, its co-founder, says the group has been going door-to-door asking people to sign a pledge of non-violence. They hope to get 50,000 to promise to “stop shooting, start thinking, and keep living.” The Newark Community Foundation, which was launched last month, announced on August 14th that it will help pay for Community Eye, a surveillance(监视) system tailored towards gun crime.

　　Cory Booker who became mayor 13 months ago with a mission to revitalize the city , believes the surveillance program will be the largest camera and audio network in any American city. More than 30 cameras were installed earlier this summer and a further 50 will be installed soon in a seven-square mile area where 80% of the city’s recent shootings have occurred. And more cameras are planned.

　　When a gunshot is detected, the surveillance camera zooms in on that spot. Similar technology in Chicago has increased arrests and decreased shootings. Mr. Booker plans to announce a comprehensive gun strategy later this week.

　　Mr. Booker, as well as church leaders and others, believes(or hopes)that after the murder the city will no longer stand by in coldness. For generations, Newark has been paralyzed by poverty ----almost one in three people lives below the poverty line----and growing indifference to crime. 

　　Some are skeptical .Steve Malanga of the conservative Manhattan Institute notes that Newark has deep social problems: over 60% of children are in homes without fathers. The school system, taken over by the state in 1995, is a mess. But there is also some cause for hope. Since Mr. Booker was elected, there has been a rise in investment and re-zoning for development. Only around 7% of nearby Newark airport workers used to come from Newark; now, a year, the figure is 30%.Mr Booker has launched a New York-style war on crime. So far this year, crime has fallen 11% and shootings are down 30 %( through the murder rate looks likely to match last year’s high).

　　46. What happened in Newark, New Jersey on August 4th?
　　A. The Newark residents witnessed a murder.
　　B. Four young people were killed in a school playground.
　　C. The new mayor of Newark took office.
　　D. Four college students fell victim to violence.
　　47. Judging from the context, the “Community Eye”(Line5,Para 2)is_____
　　A. a watching system for gun crime              B. a neighborhood protection organization
　　C. an unprofitable community business           D. a grassroots organization
　　48.We learn from the passage that Newark has all the following problems EXCEPT_____

　　A. violence                                   B. flood
　　C. poverty                                    D. indifference
　　49. Mayor Booker’s effort against crime seem to be ______
　　A. idealistic                                   B. impractical
　　C. effective                                   D. fruitless
　　50. The best title for the passage may be _____
　　A. Stop Shooting, Start Thinking, and Keep Living
　　B. Efforts to Fight against Gun Crimes
　　C. A Mission to Revitalize the City
　　D. Violent Murders in Newark

　　Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage: 

　　According to a recent survey on money and relationships, 36 percent of people are keeping a bank account from their partner. While this financial unfaithfulness may appear as distrust in a relationship , in truth it may just be a form of financial protection.

　　With almost half of all marriages ending in divorce, men and women are realizing they need to be financially savvy, regardless of whether they are in a relationship.

　　The financial hardship on individuals after a divorce can be extremely difficult, even more so when children are involved. The lack of permanency in relationships, jobs and family life may be the cause of a growing trend to keep a secret bank account hidden from a partner; in other words, an ”escape fund”.

　　Margaret’s story is far from unique. She is a representative of a growing number of women in long-term relationships who are becoming protective of their own earnings.

　　Every month on pay day, she banks hundreds of dollars into a savings account she keeps from her husband. She has been doing this throughout their six-year marriage and has built a nest egg worth an incredible $100,000 on top of her pension.

　　Margaret says if her husband found out about her secret savings he’d hurt and would interpret this as a sign she wasn’t sure of the marriage.” He’d think it was my escape fun so that financially I could afford to get out of the relationship if it went wrong. I know you should approach marriage as being forever and I hope ours is, but you can never be sure.” 

　　Like many of her fellow secret savers, Margaret was stung in a former relationship and has since been very guarded about her own money.

　　Coming clean to your partner about being a secret saver may not be all that bad. Take Colleen for example, who had been saving secretly for a few years before she confessed to her partner. ”I decided to open a savings account and start building a nest egg of my own. I wanted to prove to myself that I could put money in the bank and leave it there for a rainy day.”

　　“When John found out about my secret savings, he was a little suspicious of my motives. I reassured him that this was certainly not an escape fund that I feel very secure in out relationship. I have to admit that it does feel good to have my own money on reserve if ever there are rainy days in the future. It’s sensible to build and protect your personal financial security.”

　　51. The trend to keep a secret bank account is growing because______
　　A. escape fund helps one through rainy days       B. days are getting harder and harder
　　C. women are money sensitive                  D. financial conflicts often occur
　　52. The word “savvy”(Line2,Para 2)probably means_______
　　A. suspicious                                 B. secure
　　C. shrewd                                    D. simple
　　53. Which inference can we make about Margaret?
　　A. She is a unique woman.                      B. She was once divorced.
　　C. She is going to retire.                        D. She has many children.
　　54. The author mentions Colleen’s example to show_____
　　A. any couple can avoid marriage conflicts

　　B. privacy within marriage should be respected
　　C. everyone can save a fortune with a happy marriage
　　D. financial disclosure is not necessarily bad
　　55. Which of the following best summary this passage?
　　A. Secret Savers                              B. Love Is What It’s Worth
　　C. Banking Honesty                           D. Once Bitten, Twice Shy
　　Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage:

　　“The word ‘protection’ is no longer taboo (禁忌语)”. This short sentence, uttered by French President Nicolas Sarkozy last month, may have launched a new era in economic history. Why? For decades, Western leaders have believed that lowering trade barriers and tariffs was a natural good. Doing so, they reasoned, would lead to greater economic efficiency and productivity, which in turn would improve human welfare. Championing free trade thus became a moral, not just an economic, cause.

　　These leaders, of course, weren’t acting out of unselfishness. They knew their economies were the most competitive, so they’d profit most from liberalization. And developing countries feared that their economies would be swamped by superior Western productivity. Today, however, the tables have turned---though few acknowledge it. The West continues to preach free trade, but practices it less and less. Asian, meanwhile, continues to plead for special protection but practices more and more free trade.

　　That’s why Sarkozy’s words were so important: he finally injected some honesty into the trade debates. The truth is that large parts of the West are losing faith in tree trade, though few leaders admit it. Some economists are more honest. Paul Krugman is one of the few willing to acknowledge that protectionist arguments are returning. In the short run, there will be winners and losers under free trade. This, of course, is what capitalism is all about. But more and more of these losers will be in the West, Economists in the developed world used to love quoting Jonoph Schumpeter, who said that ‘creative destruction” was an essential part of capitalist growth. But they always assumed that destruction would happen over there. When Western workers began losing jobs, suddenly their leaders began to lose faith in their principles, Things have yet to reverse completely. But there’s clearly a negative trend in a Western theory and practice.

　　A little hypocrisy (虚伪) is not in itself a serious problem. The real problem is that Western governments continue to insist that they retain control of the key global economic and financial institutions while drifting away from global liberalization. Lock at what’s happening at the IMF (International Monetary Fund) The Europeans have demanded that they keep the post of managing director. But all too often, Western officials put their own interests above everyone else’s when they dominate these global institutions.

　　The time has therefore come for the Asians-who are clearly the new winners in today’s global economy-to provide more intellectual leadership in supporting free trade: Sadly, they have yet to do so. Unless Asians speak out, however, there’s a real danger that Adam Smith’s principles, which have brought so much good to the world, could gradually die. And that would leave all of us, worse off, in one way or another.

　　56. It can be inferred that “protection” (Line 1, Para.1) means________
　　A. improving economic efficiency.             B. ending the free-trade practice
　　C. lowering moral standard                    D. raising trade tariffs
　　57. The Western leaders preach free trade because________
　　A. it is beneficial to their economies
　　B. it is supported by developing countries
　　C. it makes them keep faith in their principles
　　D. it is advocated by Joseph Schumpeter and Adam Smith
　　58. By “the tables have turned” (Line 3-4,Para.2) the author implies that________
　　A. the Western leaders have turned self-centered
　　B. the Asian leaders have become advocates of free trade
　　C. the developed economies have turned less competitive
　　D. the developing economies have become more independent
　　59. The Western economies used to like the idea of “creative destruction” because it________
　　A. set a long-term rather than short-turn goal
　　B. was an essential part of capitalist development
　　C. contained a positive rather than negative mentality
　　D. was meant to be the destruction of developing economies

　　60. The author uses “IMF” was an example to illustrate the point that_______

　　A. European leaders are reluctant to admit they are hypocritical
　　B. there is an inconsistency between Western theory and practice
　　C. global institutions are not being led by true globalization advocates
　　D. European countries’ interests are being ignored by economic leaders

　　Section IV  Translation

　　Directions: In this section there is a paragraph in English .Translate it into Chinese and write your translation on ANSWER SHEET 2 . (20 points)

　　The term ”business model” first came into widespread use with the invention of personal computer and the spreadsheet(空白表格程序).Before the spreadsheet, business planning usually meant producing a single forecast. At best, you did a little sensitivity analysis around the projection. The spreadsheet ushered in a much more analytic approach to planning because every major line item could be pulled apart, its components and subcomponents analyzed and tested. You could ask what- if questions about the critical assumptions on which. your business depended-for example, what if customers are more price-sensitive than we thought?-and with a few keystrokes, you could see how any change would play out on every aspect of the whole. In other words, you could model the behavior of a business. Before the computer changed the nature of business planning, most successful business models were created more by accident than by elaborate design. By enabling companies to tie their marketplace insights much more tightly to the resulting economics, spread sheet made it possible to model business before they were launched.

Section III Reading comprehension (40 points)
Directions:
Read the following four passages. Answer the questions below each passage by choosing A, B, C and D. Mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET 1.

Passage One
Prior to the 20th  century, many languages with small numbers of speakers survived for centuries. The increasingly interconnected modern world makes it much more difficult for small language communities to live in relative isolation, a key factor in language maintenance and preservation.
It remains to be seen whether the world can maintain its linguistic and cultural diversity in the centuries ahead. Many powerful forces appear to work against it :population growth, which pushes migrant populations into the world’s last isolated locations; mass tourism; global telecommunications and mass media; and the spread of gigantic global corporations. All of these forces appear to signify a future in which the language of advertising, popular culture, and consumer products become similar. Already English and a few other major tongues have emerged as global languages of commerce and communication. For many of the world’s peoples, learning one of these languages is viewed as the key to education, economic opportunity, and a better way of life.
Only about 3,000 languages now in use are expected to survive the coming century. Are most of the rest doomed in the century after that?
Whether most of these languages survive will probably depend on how strongly cultural groups wish to keep their identity alive through a native language. To do so will require an emphasis on bilingualism（mastery of two languages）. Bilingual speakers could use their own language in smaller spheres---at home, among friends, in community settings---and a global language at work, in dealings with government, and in commercial spheres. In this way, many small languages could sustain their cultural and linguistic integrity alongside global languages, rather than yield to the homogenizing（同化的）forces of globalization.
Ironically, the trend of technological innovation that has threatened minority languages could also help save them. For example, some experts predict that computer software translation tools will one day permit minority language speakers to browse the Internet using their native tongues. Linguists are currently using computer―aided learning tools to teach a variety of threatened languages.
    For many endangered languages, the line between revival and death is extremely thin. Language is remarkably resilient（有活力的）,however. It is not just a tool for communicating, but also a powerful way of separating different groups, or of demonstrating group identity. Many indigenous（原生的，土著的）communities have shown that it is possible to live in the modern world while reclaiming their unique identities through language.
41.Minority languages can be best preserved in __________.
A．an increasingly interconnected world
B．maintaining small numbers of speakers
C．relatively isolated language communities
D．following the tradition of the 20th  century
42.According to Paragraph 2, that the world can maintain its linguistic diversity in the future is _______.
A．uncertain         B．unrealistic        C．foreseeable             D．definite
43.According to the author, bilingualism can help_________.
A．small languages become acceptable in work places
B．homogenize the world’s languages and cultures
C．global languages reach home and community settings
D．speakers maintain their linguistic and cultural identity
44.Computer technology is helpful for preserving minority languages in that it_________.
A．makes learning a global language unnecessary
B．facilitates the learning and using of those languages
C．raises public awareness of saving those languages
D．makes it easier for linguists to study those languages
45.In the author’s view, many endangered languages are________. 
A．remarkably well-kept in this modern world 
B．exceptionally powerful tools of communication
C．quite possible to be revived instead of dying out
D．a unique way of bringing different groups together

Passage Two
Everyone，it seems，has a health problem。After pouring billions into the National Health Service，British people moan about dirty hospitals，long waits and wasted money. In Germany the new chancellor, Angela Merkel, is under fire for suggesting changing the financing of its health system. Canada’s new Conservative Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, made a big fuss during the election about reducing the country’s lengthy medical queues. Across the rich world, affluence, ageing and advancing technology are driving up health spending faster than income. 
       But nowhere has a bigger health problem than America. Soaring medical bills are squeezing wages, swelling the ranks of the uninsured and pushing huge firms and perhaps even the government towards bankruptcy. Ford’s announcement this week that it would cut up to 30.000 jobs by 2012 was as much a sign of it’s“legacy ” health Ccare costs as of the ills of the car industry. Pushed by polls that show health care is one of his main domestic problems and by forecasts showing that the retiring baby-boomers (生育高峰期出生的人) will crush the government’s finances, George Bush is to unveil a reform ;plan in next week’s state-of Cthe Cunion address. 
    America’s health system is unlike any other. The Unite States spends 16% of its GDP on health, around twice the rich-country average, equivalent to $6,280 for every American each year. Yet it is the only rich country that does not guarantee universal health coverage. Thanks to an accident of history, most Americans receive health insurance through their employer, with the government picking up the bill for the poor and the elderly. 
    This curious hybrid（混合物） certainly has its strengths. Americans have more choice than anybody else, and their health-care system is much more innovative. Europeans’ bills could be much higher if American medicine were not doing much of their Research and Development（R&D）for them. But there are also huge weaknesses. The one most often cited―especially by foreigners―is the army of uninsured. Some 46 million Americans do not have cover. In many cases that is out of choice and ,if they fall seriously ill, hospitals have to treat them. But it is still deeply unequal. And there are also shocking inefficiencies: by some measures,30% of American health spending is wasted. 
       Then there is the question of state support. Many Americans disapprove of the “socialized medicine” of Canada and Europe. In fact, even if much of the administration is done privately, around 60% of America’s heath-care bill ends up being met by the government. Proportionately, the American state already spends as much on health as the OECD（Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development）average, and that share is set to grow as the baby-boomers run up their Medicare bills and ever more employers avoid providing health-care coverage. America is , in effect, heading towards a version of socialized medicine by default. 

46.Health problems mentioned in the passage include all the following EXCEPT_________. 
  A. poor hospital conditions in U.K. 
  B. Angela Merkel under attack 
  C. health financing in Germany 
  D. long waiting lines in Canada 
47.Ford’s announcement of cutting up to 30,000 jobs by 2012 indicates that Ford_________. 
  A. has the biggest health problem of the car industry  
  B. has made profits from its health-care legacy 
  C. has accumulated too heavy a health-care burden 
  D. owes a great deal of debt to its employees 
48.In the author’s opinion, America’s health system is _________. 
  A. inefficient               B. feasible        C. unpopular                    D. successful 
49.It is implied in the passage that_________. 
  A. America’s health system has its strengths and weaknesses 
  B. the US government pays medical bills for the poor and the elderly  
  C. some 46 million Americans do not have medical insurance 
  D. Europeans benefit a lot from America’s medical research 
50.from the last paragraph we may learn that the “socialized medicine” is____________. 
  A. a practice of Canada and Europe 
  B. a policy adopted by the US government 
  C. intended for the retiring baby-boomers 
  D. administered by private enterprises 

Passage Three
When Thomas Keller, one of America’s foremost chefs, announced that on Sept. I he would abolish the practice of tipping at Per Se. his luxury restaurant in New York City, and replace it with European-style service charge, I knew three groups would be opposed: customers, servers and restaurant owners. These three groups are all committed to tipping――as they quickly made clear on Web sites. To oppose tipping , it seems, is to be anticapitalist , and maybe even a little French.. 
    But Mr. Keller is right to move away from tipping―and it’s worth exploring why just about everyone else in the restaurant world is wrong to stick with the practice. 
    Customers believe in tipping because they think it makes economic sense.“Waiters know that they won’t get paid if they don’t do a good job”is how most advocates of the system would put it. To be sure, this is a tempting, apparently rational statement about economic theory, but it appears to have little applicability to the real world of restaurants. 
    Michael Lynn, an associate professor of  consumer behavior and marketing at Cornell’s School of Hotel Administration, has conducted dozens of students of tipping and has concluded that consumers assessments of the quality of service correlate weakly to the amount they tip. 
    Rather, customers are likely to tip more in response to servers touching them lightly and leaning forward next to the table to make conversation than to how often their water glass is refilled――in other words, customers tip more when they like the server, not when the service is good. Mr. Lynn’s studies also indicate that male customers increase their tips for female servers while female customers increase their tips for male servers,. 
    What’s more,. consumers seem to forget that the tip increases as the bill increases. Thus, the tipping system is an open invitation to what restaurant professionals call “upwelling”: every bottle of imported water, every espresso and every cocktail is extra money in the server’s pocket. Aggressive upwelling for tips is often rewarded while low-key, quality service often goes unrecognized. 
　　In addition , the practice of tip pooling , which is the norm in fine-dining restaurants and is becoming more in every kind of restaurant above the level of a greasy spoon , has ruined whatever effect voting with your tip might have had on an individual waiter . In an unreasonable outcome , you are punishing the good waiters in the restaurant by not tipping the bad one . Indeed , there appear to be little connection between tipping and good service . 
Questions 41 to 45 are based on the following passage:   Prior to the 20th  century, many languages with small numbers of speakers survived for centuries. The increasingly interconnected modern world makes it much more difficult for small language communities to live in relative isolation, a key factor in language maintenance and preservation.
It remains to be seen whether the world can maintain its linguistic and cultural diversity in the centuries ahead. Many powerful forces appear to work against it :population growth, which pushes migrant populations into the world’s last isolated locations; mass tourism; global telecommunications and mass media; and the spread of gigantic global corporations.

Only about 3,000 languages now in use are expected to survive the coming century. Are most of the rest doomed in the century after that?
Whether most of these languages survive will probably depend on how strongly cultural groups wish to keep their identity alive through a native language. To do so will require an emphasis on bilingualism（mastery of two languages）.

Many indigenous（原生的，土著的）communities have shown that it is possible to live in the modern world while reclaiming their unique identities through language.

Passage Four
“I promise.” “ I swear to you it’ll never happen again.” “I give you my word.” “Honestly. Believe me.” Sure, I trust. Why not? I teach English composition at a private college. With a certain excitement and intensity. I read my students’ essays, hoping to find the person behind the pen. As each semester progresses, plagiarism（剽窃）appears. Not only is my intelligence insulted as one assumes I won’t detect a polished piece of prose from an otherwise-average writer, but I feel a sadness that a student has resorted to buying a paper from a peer. Writers have styles like fingerprints and after several assignments, I can match a student’s work with his or her name even if it’s missing from the upper left-hand corner. 
   Why is learning less important than a higher grade-point average（GPA）? When we’re threatened or sick, we make conditional promises. “If you let me pass math I will ….” “Lord, if you get me over this before the big homecoming game I’ll….” Once the situation is behind us, so are the promises. Human nature? Perhaps, but we do use that cliché（陈词滥调）to get us out of uncomfortable bargains. Divine interference during distress is asked; gratitude is unpaid. After all, few fulfill the contract, so why should anyone be the exception. Why not ? 
   Six years ago, I took a student before the dean. He had turned in an essay with the vocabulary and sentence structure of PhD thesis. Up until that time, both his out-of-class and in-class work were borderline passing. 
I questioned the person regarding his essay and he swore it I’d understand this copy would not have the time and attention an out-of-class paper is given, but  he had already a finished piece so he understood what was asked. He sat one hour, then turned in part of a page of unskilled writing and faulty logic. I confronted him with both essays. “I promise…., I’m not lying. I swear to you that I wrote the essay. I’m just nervous today.” 
   The head of the English department agreed with my finding, and the meeting with the dean had the boy’s parents present. After an hour of discussion, touching on eight of the boy’s previous essays and his grade-point average, which indicated he was already on academic probation（留校察看）, the dean agreed that the student had plagiarized. His parents protested, “He’s only a child” and we instructors are wiser and should be compassionate. College people are not really children and most times would resent being labeled as such…. Except in this uncomfortable circumstance.

56.According to the author, students commit plagiarism mainly for_____. 
A．money           B．degree           C．higher GPA            D．reputation 
57.the sentence “ Once the situation is behind us , so are the promises’ implies that_________. 
A．students usually keep their promises 
B．some students tend to break their promises 
C．the promises are always behind the situation 
D．we cannot judge the situation in advance, as we do to the promises 
58.The “borderline passing”（Line 3,Para.3）probably means____________. 
A．fairly good                         B．extremely poor  
C．above average                    D．below average 
59.The boy’s parents thought their son should be excused mainly because_______________. 
A．teachers should be compassionate 
B．he was only a child 
C．instructors were wiser 
D．he was threatened 
60.Which of the following might serve as the title of this passage? 
A．Human Nature                     B．Conditional Promises 
C．How to Detect Cheating          D．The Sadness of Plagiarism

Directions:
In this section there is a passage in English. Translate the five sentences underlined into Chinese and write your translation on ANSWER SHEET 2.  

Powering the great ongoing changes of our time is the rise of human creativity as the defining feature of economic life. Creativity has come to be valued, because new technologies, new industries and new wealth flow from it. And as a result, our lives and society have begun to echo with creative ideas. It is our commitment to creativity in its varied dimensions that forms the underlying spirit of our age. 
    Creativity is essential to the way we live and work today, and in many senses always has been. The big advances in standard of living C-not to mention the big competitive advantages in the marketplace--always have come from” better recipes, not just more cooking.” One might argue that’s not strictly true. One might point out, for instance, that during the long period from the early days on the Industrial Revolution to modern times, much of the growth in productivity and material wealth in the industrial nations came not just from creative inventions like the steam engine, but from the widespread application of “cooking in quantity” business methods like massive division of labor ,concentration of assets, vertical integration and economies of scale. But those methods themselves were creative developments.

　　Section III  Reading comprehension (40 points)

　　Directions:

　　Read the following four passages. Answer the questions below each passage by choosing A, B, C and D. Mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET 1.

　　Passage One

　　Office jobs are among the positions hardest hit by compumation (计算机自动化). Word processors and typists will lose about 93，000 jobs over the next few years， while 57，000 secretarial jobs will vanish. Blame the PC: Today， many executives type their own memos and carry there” secretaries” in the palms of their hands. Time is also hard for stock clerks， whose ranks are expected to decrease by 68，000. And employees in manufacturing firms and wholesalers are being replaced with computerized systems.

　　But not everyone who loses a job will end up in the unemployment line. Many will shift to growing positions within their own companies. When new technologies shook up the telecomm business， telephone operator Judy Dougherty pursued retraining. She is now a communications technician， earning about $ 64，000 per year. Of course， if you’ve been a tollbooth collector for the past 30 years， and you find yourself replaced by an E ZPass machine， it may be of little consolation(安慰) to know that the telecom field is booming. 

　　And that’s just it: The service economy is fading: welcome to the expertise(专门知识) economy. To succeed in the new job market， you must be able to handle complex problems. Indeed， all but one of the 50 highest-paying occupations---air-traffic controller---demand at least a bachelor’s degree.

　　For those with just a high school diploma(毕业证书).It’s going to get tougher to find a well-paying job. Since fewer factory and clerical jobs will be available .what’s left be the jobs that compumations can’t kill， computers cant clean offices ，or for Alzheimer’s patients(老年痴呆病人). But ，since most people have the skills to fill those positions， the wages stay painfully low ，meaning compumation could drive an even deeper wedge (楔子) between the and poor， The best advice now ，Never stop learning ，and keep up with new technology.

　　For busy adults of course that can be tough ，The good news is that very technology that’s reducing so many jobs is a making it easier to go back to school without having to sit in a classroom. So called internet distance learning is hot， with more than three million students currently enrolled ， and it’s gaining credibility with employers.

　　Are you at risk of losing your job to a computer ？ Check the federal Bureau of Labor

　　Statistics’ Occupational Outlook Handbook ，which is available online at bls.gov .

　　41.Prom the first paragraph we can infer that all of the following persons are easily thrown into unemployment EXCEPT.
　　A secretaries        B stock clerks       C managers        D wholesalers

　　42、In the second paragraph the anther mentions the tollbooth collector to
　　A mean he will get benefits from the telecomm fled
　　B show he is too old to shift to a new position
　　C console him on having been replaced by a machine
　　D blame the PC for his unemployment

　　43.By saying “ ┅ compumation could drive an even deeper wedge between the rich and poor “(line 5. Para 4 )the author means

　　A people are getting richer and richer
　　B there will be a small gap between rich and poor
　　C the gap between rich and poor is getting larger an larger
　　D it’s time to close up be gap between the rich and poor

　　44．What is the author’s attitude towards computers？
　A positive       B negative       C neutral      D prejudiced

　　45．Which of the following might serve as the best title of passage？
　　A Blaming the PC
　　B The booming telecomm field
　　C Internet distance leaning
　　D Keeping up with compumation

　　

　　Passage Two

　　Tens of thousands of 18 year olds will graduate this year and be handed meaningless diplomas .These diplomas won’t look any different from awarded their luckier classmates Their validity will be questioned only when their employers discover the these graduates are semiliterate(半文盲)

　　Eventually a fortunate few will find their way into educational C repair C adult C literacy

　　Programs， such as the one where I teach grammar and writing .There ，high school graduates and high school dropouts pursuing graduate equivalency certificates will learn the skills they should have learned in school ，They will discover they have been cheated by our educational system.

　　I will never forget a teacher senior when be had her for English .“He site in the back of the room talking to his friends “.she told me ，” Why don’t you move him to the front row？

　　I urged believing the embarrassment would get him to settle down， Mrs. Stifter said ，"I don’t move seniors. I think (使┅不及格) them.” Our son’s academic life flashed before my eyes. No teacher had ever threatened him. By the time I got home I was feeling pretty good this .It was a radical approach for these times ，but well. Why not ？ She’s going to flunk you “ I told my son.

　　I did not discuss it any further.Suddenly English became a priorty (头等重要) in his life.He finished out the semester with an A.

　　I know one example doesn’t make a case，but at night I see a parade of students who are angry for having been passed along until they could no longer even pretend to keep up.Of average intelligence or better，they eventually quit school，concluding they were too dumb to finish.” I should have been held back，” is a comment I hear frequently.Even sadder are those students who are high-school graduates who say to me after a few weeks of class.”I don’t know how I ever got a high-school diploma.”

　　Passing students who have not mastered the work cheats them and the employers who expect graduates to have basic skills.We excuse this dishonest behavior by saying kids can’t learn if they come from terrible environments.No one seems to stop to think that most kids don’t put school first on their list unless they perceive something is at risk.They’d rather be sailing.

　　Many students I see at night have decided to make education a priority.They are motivated by the desire for a better job or the need to hang on to the one they’ve got.They have a healthy fear of failure.

　　People of all ages can rise above their problems，but they need to have a reason to do so.Yong people generally don’t have the maturity to value education in the same way my adult students value it.But fear of failure can motivate both.

　　46.What is the subject of this essay？
　　A view point on learning
B a qualified teacher
　　C the importance of examination
　　D the generation gap

　　47.How did Mrs.Sifter get the attention of one of the author’s children？
　　A flunking him
　　B moving his seat
　　C blaming him
　　D playing card with him

　　48.The author believes that most effective way for a teacher is to
　　A purify the teaching environments .
　　B set up cooperation between teachers and parents.
　　C hold back student.
　　D motivate student.

　　49. From the passage we can draw the conclusion that the authors’ attitude toward flunking is

　　A negative
　　B positive
　　C biased
　　D indifferent

　　50. Judging from the content ，this passage is probably written for

　　A administrators
　　B students
　　C teachers
　　D parents

　　Passage Three

　　Names have gained increasing importance in the competitive world of higher education. As colleges strive for market share， they are looking for names that project the image they want or reflect the changes they hope to make. Trenton.State College， for example ，became the College of New Jersey nine years ago when it began raising admissions standards and appealing to students from throughout the state.

　　“All I hear in higher education is， “Brand ，brand ，brand，” said Tim Westerbeck， who specializes in branding and is managing director of Lipman Hearne， a marketing firm based in Chicago that works with universities and other nonprofit organizations. “There has been a sea change over the last 10 years. Marketing used to be almost a dirty word in higher education.”

　　Not all efforts at name changes are successful， ofcourse . In 1997 ， the New School for Social Research became New School University to reflect its growth into a collection of eight colleges， offering a list of majors that includes psychology， music ，urban studies and management. But New Yorkers continued to call it the New School .

　　Now，after spending an undisclosed sum on an online survey and a marketing consultant’s creation of “haming structures.” “brand architecture” and “ identity systems，” the university has come up with a new name: the New School.Beginning Monday， it will adopt new logon (标识)， banners， business cards and even new names for the individual colleges， all to include the words “the New School.”

　　Changes in names generally reveal significant shifts in how a college wants to be perceived. In altering its name from Cal State. Hayward， to Cal State， East Bay， the university hoped to project its expanding role in two mostly suburban countries east of San Francisco.

　　The University of Southern Colorado， a state institution， became Colorado State University at Pucblo two years ago， hoping to bighight many internal changes， including offering more graluate programs and setting higher admissions standards.

　　Beaver College turned itself into Arcadia University in 2001 for several reasons: to break the connection with its past as a women’s college， to promote its growth into a full-fledged(完全成熟的) university and officials acknowledged， to climinate some jokes about the college’s old name on late-night television and “moring zoo” radio shows.

　　Many college officials said changing a name and image could produce substantial results. At Arcadia，in addition to the rise in applications，the average student’s test score has increased by 60 points，Juli Roebeck，an Arcadia spokeswoman said.

　　51. which of the following is NOT the reason for colleges to change their names？

　　A They prefer higher education competition
　　B They try to gain advantage in market share.
　C They want to project their image.
　　D They hope to make some changes.

　　52. It is implied that one of the most significant changes in highter education in the past decade is

　　A the brand.
　　B the college names
　　C the concept of marketing
　　D list of majors.

　　53.The thrase "come up with"(Line 3 Para 4)probably means
　　A catch up with
　　B deal with
　　C put forward
　　D come to the realizatoin

　　54 The case of name changing from Cal State Hayward to Cal State indicates that the university
　　A is perceived by the society
　　B hopes to expand its influence
　　C prefers to reform its reaching programs
　　D expects to enlange its campus

　　55.According to the spokeswoman the name change of Beaver College
　　A turns out very successful
　　B fails to attain its goal
　　C has eliminated some jokes
　　D has transformed its status

　　Passage Four

　　it looked just like another aircraft from the outside The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964.But apperances were deceptive and the 13 students from Europe and the USA who boarded the aiecraft were in for the fligt of their lives.

　　Inside the area that normally had seats had become a long white tunnel.Heavily padded(填塞) from floor to ceiling it looked abit strange. There were almost no windows ，but ligts along the padded walls illuminated it.Most of the seats had been taken out apart from afew at the back where the young scientists quickly took their places with a look of fear.

　　For 12 months，science students from across the continents had competed to win a place on the flight at the invitation of the European Space Agency .the challenge had been to suggest imaginative experments to be conducted in weightless condtions.

　　For the next two hours the flight resembled that of an onormous bird which had lose its reson，shooting upwards towards the heavens before rushing towards Earth.The invention was to Achieve weightlessness for a few seconds.

　　The aircraft took off smoothly enough. But any feelings that I and the young scientists had that we were on anything like a scheduled passenger service were quickly dismissed when the pilot put the plane into a 45 degree climb which lasted around 20 seconds. Then the engines cut our and we became weightless. Everything become confused and left or right. Up or down no longer had any meaning. after ten seconds of free fall descent the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nosedive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss. but was still sudden enough to ensure that some students came down with a bump.

　　Each time the pilot cut the engines and we became weightless. A new team conduct it experience. First it was the Ducth who wanted to discover how it is that cats always land on their feet. then the German team who conducted a successful experiment on a traditional building method to see if could be used for building a futher space station .the Americans had an idea to create solar sails that could be used by satellites.

　　After two hours of going up and down in the lane doing their experiments， the predominate feeling was one of excitement rather than sickness. Most of the students thought it was an unforgettable experience and one they would be keen to repeat.

　　56、what did the writer say about the plane？.
　　A It had no seats.
　　B It was painted white.
　　C It had no windows.
　　D The outside was misleading.

　　57.according to the writer ，how did the young scientists feel before the flight？
　　A sick
　　B keen
　　C nervous
　　D impatient

　　58.what did the pilot do with the plane after it took off？

　　B He climbed and them made the plane fall slowly.
　　C He took off normally and then cut the engines for 20 seconds.
　　D He climbed and then made the plane turn over.

　　59.Acoording to the passage，the purpose of being weightless was to

　　A see what conditions bare like in space
　　B prepare the young scientists for future work in space

　　C show the judges of the competition what they could do

　　Directions:

　　In this section there is a passage in English. Translate the five sentences underlined into Chinese and write your translation on ANSWER SHEET 2.

　　The smooth landing of shuttle（航天飞机）Discovery ended a flight that was successful in almost every respect but one：the dislodging of a big chunk of foam，like the one that doomed the Columbia. This flight was supposed to vault the shuttle fleet back into space after a prolonged grounding for repairs. But given the repeat of the very problem that two years of retooling was supposed to resolve，the verdict is necessarily mixed.（61）Once again，the space agency has been forced to put off the flight until it can find a solution to the problem，and no one seems willing to guess how that may take .

　　The Discovery astronauts performed superbly during their two-week mission，and the shuttle looked better than ever in some respects.（62）space officials were justifiably happy that so much had gone well，despite daily worries over possible risks. the flight clearly achieved its prime objectives.

　　The astronauts transferred tons of cargo to the international space station，which has been limping along overhead with a reduced crew and limited supplies carried up on smaller Russian spacecraft .（63）They replaced a broken device .repaired another and carted away a load of rubbish that had been left on the station，showing the shuttle can bring full loads back down from space.

　　This was the most scrutinized shuttle flight ever. with the vehicle undergoing close inspection while still in orbit.（64）New sensing and photographic equipment to look for potentially dangerous damage to the sensitive external skin proved valuable .A new back flip maneuver allowed station astronauts to photograph the shuttle‘s underbelly .and an extra-long robotic arm enabled astronauts see parts of the shuttle that were previously out of sight .

　　（65）The flood of images and the openness in discussing its uncertainties about potential hazards sometimes made it appear that the shuttle was about to fall apart，In the end the damage was clearly tolerable . A much-touted spacewalk to repair the shuttle‘s skin the first of its kind moved an astronaut close enough to pluck out some protruding material with his hand Preliminary evidence indicates that Discovery has far fewer nicks and gouges than shuttles on previous flights.

　　perhaps showing that improvements to reduce the shedding of debris from the external fuel tank have had some success .

　　Section III  Reading comprehension (40 points)

　　Directions:

　　Read the following four passages. Answer the questions below each passage by choosing A, B, C and D. Mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET 1.

　　Passage One

　　Working  at  nonstandard  times-----evenings,  nights,  or  weekends----is  taking  its  toll  on  American  families.  One-fifth  of  all  employed  Americans  work  variable  or  rotating  shifts,  and  one-third  work  weekends,  according  to  Harriet  B.  Presser,  sociology  professor  at  the  University  of  Maryland.  The  result  is  stress  on  familial  relationships,  which  is  likely  to  continue  in  coming  decades.

　　The  consequences  of  working  irregular  hours  vary  according  to  gender,  economic  level,  and  whether  or  not  children  are  involved.  Single  mothers  are  more  likely  to  work  nights  and  weekends  than  married  mothers.  Women  in  clerical,  sales,  or  other  low-paying  jobs  participate  disproportionately  in  working  late  and  graveyard  shifts.

　　Married-couple  households  with  children  are  increasingly  becoming  dual-earner  households,  generating  more  split-shift  couples.  School-aged  children,  however,  may  benefit  from  parents’  nonstandard  work  schedules  because  of  the  greater  likelihood  that  a  parent  will  be  home  before  or  after  school.  On  the  other  hand,  a  correlation  exists  between  nonstandard  work  schedules  and  both  marital  instability  and  a  decline  in  the  quality  of  marriages.

　　Nonstandard  working  hours  mean  families  spend  less  time  together  for  diner  but  more  time  together  for  breakfast.  One-on-one  interaction  between  parents  and  children  varies,  however,  based  on  parent,  shift,  and  age  of  children.  There  is  also  a  greater  reliance  on  child  care  by  relatives  and  by  professional  providers.

　　Working  nonstandard  hours  is  less  a  choice  of  employees  and  more  a  mandate  of  employer.  Presser  believes  that  the  need  for  swing  shifts  and  weekend  work  will  continue  to  rise  in  the  coming  decades.  She  reports  that  in  some  European  countries  there  are  substantial  salary  premiums  for  employees  working  irregular  hours-sometimes  as  much  as  50%  higher.  The  convenience  of  having  services  available  24  hours  a  day  continues  to  drive  this  trend.

　　Unfortunately,  says  Presser,  the  issue  is  virtually  absent  from  public  discourse.  She  emphasizes  the  need  for  focused  studies  on  costs  and  benefits  of  working  odd  hours,  the  physical  and  emotional  health  of  people  working  nights  and  weekends,  and  the  reasons  behind  the  necessity  for  working  these  hours.  “Nonstandard  work  schedules  not  only  are  highly  prevalent  among  American  families  but  also  generate  a  level  of  complexity  in  family  functioning  that  needs  greater  attention,”  she  says./

　　36．Which  of  the  following  demonstrates  that  working  at  nonstandard  times  is  taking  its  toll  on  American  families？
　　A．Stress  on  familial  relationships．
　　B．Rotating  shifts.
　　C．Evenings，nights，or  weekends.
　　D．Its  consequences.

　　C．Employees
　　D．Professional  child  providers.

　　A．emphasized

　　40．What  is  the  author’s  attitude  towards  working  irregular  hours？

　　Passage Two

　　Most  human  beings  actual1y  decide  before  they  think.  When  any  human  being----executive,  specialized    expert,  or  person  in  the  street----encounters  a  complex  issue  and  forms  an  opinion,  often  within  a  matter  of  seconds,  how  thoroughly  has  he  or  she  explored  the  implications  of  the  various  courses  of  action?  Answer:  not  very  thoroughly.  Very  few  people,  no  matter  how  inte1ligent  or  experienced,  can  take  inventory  of  the  many  branching  possibilities,  possible  outcomes,  side  effects,  and  undesired  consequences  of  a  policy  or  a  course  of  action  in  a  matter  of  seconds.  Yet,  those  who  pride  themse1ves  on  being  decisive  often  try  to  do  just  that.  And  once  their  brains  lock  onto  an  opinion,  most  of  their  thinking  thereafter  consists  of  finding  support  for  it.

　　A  very  serious  side  effect  of  argumentative  decision  making  can  be  a  lack  of  support  for  the  chosen  course  of  action  on  the  pat  of  the  “losing”  faction.  When  one  faction  wins  the  meeting  and  the  others  see  themselves  as  losing,  the  battle  often  doesn’t  end  when  the  meeting  ends.  Anger,  resentment,  and  jealousy  may  lead  them  to  sabotage  the  4ecision  later,  or  to  reopen  the  debate  at  later  meetings.

　　There  is  a  better.  As  philosopher  Aldous  Huxley  said,  “It  isn’t  who  is  right,  but  what  is  right,  that  counts.”

　　The  structured-inquiry  method  offers  a  better  alternative  to  argumentative  decision  making  by  debate.  With  the  help  of  the  Internet  and  wireless  computer  technology  the  gap  between  experts  and  executives  is  now  being  dramatically  closed.  By  actually  putting  the  brakes  on  the  thinking  process,  slowing  it  down,  and  organizing  the  flow  of  logic,  it’s  possible  to  create  a  level  of  clarity  that  sheer  argumentation  can  never  match.

　　The  structured-inquiry  process  introduces  a  level  of  conceptual  clarity  by  organizing  the  contributions  of  the  experts,  then  brings  the  experts  and  the  decision  makers  closer  together.  Although  it  isn’t  possible  or  necessary  for  a  president  or  prime  minister  to  listen  in  on  every  intelligence  analysis  meeting,  it’s  possible  to  organize  the  experts’ information  to  give  the  decision  maker  much  greater  insight  as  to  its  meaning.  This  process  may  somewhat  resemble  a  marketing  focus  group; it’s  a  simple,  remarkably  clever  way  to  bring  decision  makers  closer  to  the  source  of  the  expert  information  and  opinions  on  which  they  must  base  their  decisions.

　　Passage Three

　　Sport  is  heading  for  an  indissoluble  marriage  with  television  and  the  passive  spectator  will  enjoy  a  private  paradise.  All  of  this  will  be  in  the  future  of  sport.  The  spectator  (the  television  audience)  will  be  the  priority  and  professional  clubs  will  have  to  readjust  their  structures  to  adapt  to  the  new  reality:  sport  as  a  business.

　　The  new  technologies  will  mean  that  spectators  will  no  longer  have  to  wait  for  broadcasts  by  the  conventional  channels.  They  will  be  the  ones  who  decide  what  to  see.  And  they  will  have  to  pay  for  it.  In  the  United  States  the  system  of  the  future  has  already  started:  pay-as-you-view.  Everything  will  be  offered  by  television  and  the  spectator  will  only  have  to  choose.  The  review  Sports  Illustrated  recently  published  a  full  profile  of  the  life  of  the  supporter  at  home  in  the  middle  of  the  next  century.  It  explained  that  the  consumers  would  be  able  to  select  their  view  of  the  match  on  a  gigantic,  flat  screen  occupying  the  whole  of  one  wall,  with  images  of  a  clarity  which  cannot  be  foreseen  at  present;  they  could  watch  from  the  trainer’s  stands  just  behind  the  batter  in  a  game  of  baseball  or  from  the  helmet  of  the  star  player  in  an  American  football  game.  And  at  their  disposal  will  be  the  sane  option  s  the  producer  of  the  recorded  programmer  has  to  select  replays,  to  choose  which  camera  to  me  and  to  decide  on  the  sound  whether  to  hear  the  public,  the  players,  the  trainer  and  so  on.

　　Many  sports  executives,  largely  too  old  and  too  conservative  to  feel  at  home  with  the  new  technologies  will  believe  that  sport  must  control  the  expansion  of  television  coverage  in  order  to  survive  and  ensure  that  spectators  attend  matches.  They  do  not  even  accept  the  evidence  which  contradicts  their  view  while  there  is  more  basketball  than  ever  on  television,  for  example,  it  is  also  certain  that  basketball  is  more  popular  than  ever.

　　It  is  also  the  argument  of  these  sports  executives  that  television  harming  the  modest  teams.  This  is  true,  but  the  future  of  those  team is  also  modest.  They  have  reached  their  ceiling  .  It  is  the  law  of  the  market.  The  great  events  continually  attract  larger  audience.

　　The  world  I  being  constructed  on  new  technologies  so  that  people  can  make  the  utmost  use  of  their  time  and  ,  in  their  home  have  access  to  the  greatest  possible  range  of  recreational  activities.  Sport  will  have  to  adapt  itself  to  the  new  world.

　　The  most  visionary  executives  go  further.  That  philosophy  is:  rather  than  see  television  take  over  sport  why  not  have  sports  taken  over  television?

　　46．What  does  the  writer  mean  by  use  of  the  phrase  “an  indissoluble  marriage”  in  the  first  paragraph?/

　　A．sport  is  combined  with  television.
　　B．sport  controls  television.

　　D．Technologies  can  go  hand  in  hand  with  sports.

　　Passage Four

　　Convenience  food  helps  companies  by  creating  growth,  but  what  is  its  effect  on  people?  For  people  who  think  cooking  was  the  foundation  of  civilization  ,the  microwave  is  the  last  enemy.  The  communion  of  eating  together

　　Is  easily  broken  by  a  device  that  liberates  households  citizens  from  waiting  for  mealtimes.  The  first  great  revolution  in  the  history  of  food  is  in  danger  of  being  undone.  The  companionship  of  the  campfire,  cooking  pot  and  common  table,  which  have  helped  to  bond  humans  in  collaborative  living  for  at  least  150000  years  could  be  destroyed.

　　Meals  have  certainly  sated  from  the  rise  of  convenience  food.  The  only  meals  regularly  taken  together  in  Britain  these  days  are  at  the  weekend,  among  rich  families  struggling  to  retain  something  of  the  old  symbol  of  togetherness.  Indeed,  the  day’s  first  meal  has  all  but  disappeared.  In  the  20th  century  the  leisure  British  breakfast  was  undermined  by  the  corn  flake;  in  the  21st  breakfast  is  vanishing  altogether  a  victim  of  the  quick  cup  of  coffee  in  Starbucks  and  the  cereal  bar.

　　Convenience  food  has  also  made  people  forget  how  to  cook  one  of  the  apparent  paradoxes  of  modern  food  is  that  while  the  amount  of  time  spent  cooking  meals  has  fallen  from  60  minutes  a  day  in  1980  to  13M  a  day  in  2002,  the  number  of  cooks  and  television  programmer  on  cooking  has  multiplied.  But  perhaps  this  isn’t  a  paradox.  Maybe  it  is  became  people  can’t  cook  anymore,  so  they  need  to  be  told  how  to  do  it,  or  maybe  it  is  because  people  buy  books  about  hobbies---golf,  yachting  ---not  about  chores.  Cooking  has  ceased  to  be  a  chore  and  has  become  a  hobby.

　　Although  everybody  lives  in  the  kitchen.  its  facilities  are  increasingly  for  display  rather  than  for  use.  Mr.  Silverstein’s  now  book,  ”trading  up”  look  at  mid-range  consumer’s  milling  now  to  splash  out.  He  says  that  industrial  --style  Viking  cook  pot,  with  nearly  twice  the  heat  output  of  other  ranges,  have  helped  to  push  the  “kitchen  as  theater”  trend  in  hour  goods.  They  cost  from  $1000  to  $9000.Some  75%  of    them  are  never  used.

　　Convenience  also  has  an  impact  on  the  healthiness,  or  otherwise,  of  food  ,of  course  there  is  nothing  bad  about  ready  to  eat  food  itself.  You  don’t  get  much  healthier  than  an  apple,  and  supermarkets  sell  a  better  for  you  range  of  ready-meals.  But  there  is  a  limit  to  the  number  of  apples  people  want  to  eat;  and  these  days  it  is  easier  for  people  to  eat  the  kind  of  food  that  makes  them  fat  The  three  Harvard  economists  in  their  paper  “why  have  Americans  become  more  obese?”  point  out  that  in  the  past,  if  people  wanted  to  eat  fatty  hot  food,  they  had  to  cook  it.  That  took  time  and  energy  a  good  chip  needs  frying  twice,  once  to  cook  the  potato  and  once  to  get  it  crispy.  Which  discouraged  of  consumption  of  that  cost  of  food.  Mass  preparation  of  food  took  away  that  constraint.  Nobody  has  to  cut  and  d ouble  cook  their  own  fries  these  days.  Who  has  the  time?
